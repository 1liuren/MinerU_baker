Furthermore, as represented by the word \"smart city\", etc., development that integrates urban development and automobile and mobility is also in progress. Technology development that takes human factors into consideration, such as how people will be affected and how people react to infrastructure in response to driving interventions from automobiles, will be essential. So far, these issues have been examined through traffic experiments using actual vehicles in the field of operation, but they require a lot of energy and time, and the impact on the daily life of neighborhood residents cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is required to conduct social experiments efficiently and to promote technology development in consideration of human factors."

In addition, during the evaluation, (6) it is carried out repeatedly until (7) the brake timing of the preceding vehicle matches the plan, while taking care of safety.

On the DS, the hazard level can be set freely in the general traffic environments, and it is possible to evaluate all conditions including the change of the specification from the presence or absence of the ITS infrastructure. Until the concept of ITS appeared, the use of DS was limited to automotive- related research institutes and enterprises. However, since the installation of ITS infrastructure started to be examined, the use of DS has spread to the electronics manufacturers related to the infrastructure."

First, traffic accidents to be addressed are identified from the accident statistics analyses and the accident situation analyses, and then a simulator is used to find out what kind of driver's driving behavior causes the accidents."

In these controls, almost the same size as the intersection is required in order to reproduce the vehicle movement at one intersection. In addition, since the translation device needs to be prepared for the next movement, the dome is set to gradually move to the center. This is called washback, which is implemented so that a driver does not feel it."

Furthermore, the linear guide requires a parallel mounting accuracy of 70 microns or less, where a steel pipe structure is adopted to make the saddle highly rigid and lightweight."

A DS equipped with functions that involve longitudinal movement and lateral movement can simulate ordinary driving scenarios to emergency driving scenarios, and can also present large acceleration/deceleration to experimental participants. This shows that it is possible to use a DS to evaluate the ADAS that supports emergencies and the evaluation of future automated driving systems. In addition, with the progress of virtual reality technology, it has become possible to present visual information to experimental participants using a high- resolution device, and in the future, small- scale driving will be utilized by utilizing head- mounted display technology."

However, in the full- fledged DS that uses a large screen and real car seats, reproduction of sensible acceleration and simulation of road traffic environments are emphasized."

Therefore, some installation space is required. In the simple DS, the installation space of the DS is drastically reduced by using the monitors which display the driving scene. And, the DS equipment itself becomes large, because the cockpit over the advanced DS utilizes the cockpit of the actual vehicle. Contrary to this, the simple DS has a minimum configuration of only a steering wheel, necessary switches, seat, and pedals, and the meters are drawn while presenting a driving scene, and simple meters are installed on the upper part of the steering wheel. By doing so, it almost becomes the usual installation space of a desk and chair for one person, and the installation space can be drastically reduced. Then, the installation space including the direction of the height is decided by the configuration of the moving system, and the introduction cost increases. This moving system is often a hurdle for introduction of DS. Therefore, in the simple DS, a simple moving system is used."

However, there is a possibility that the driver under full automated driving does not see the driving scene in front, and the driving feeling cannot be obtained at all, if the driver closes his eyes. Therefore, though not sufficient, a simple moving device like BlueTiger was introduced. The sensory experience of the vibration surface which cannot be expressed by BlueTiger is only yaw, and it was judged that it would not be unrealistic even if the yaw is omitted, because the generation quantity of yaw is very small in automated driving which drives on the expressway of straight lines and gentle curves."

The image of the road was presented with the help of computer graphics (CG) images by three projectors, and the reaction force of the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake was presented to the driver."

However, for example, when the scale factor is set to 0.8 in experiments with sudden braking, the motion of deceleration can be simulated continuously even in experiments with a large deceleration. For reproducing it as it is an actual- vehicle motion, the scale factor of the motion device would be set to 1.0. However, in that case, the simulator can cause motion sickness to a driver or passengers because the motion device moves faster during experiments. Therefore, the SIoTDS- T is required to operate with the proper setting of the scale factor."

The purpose of using this simple DS is to analyze the driver state during automatic operation. Since the amount of yaw generated is very small in self- driving straight lines and on highways with gentle curves, it does not feel unrealistic without presenting yaw movement. If the purpose of use is limited, the simple DS should be sufficiently usable in the future."

Since the motion device simulates longitudinal and lateral movement, it was possible to simulate the movement of a vehicle and present it to the participants in various driving scenarios. The UoLDS system can be equipped with the functions of an ADAS or an automated driving system. And since it has a high- level vehicle motion simulation function, it can simulate for a wide range of driving scenes from emergency situations to ordinary driving."

However, if we consider the DS as a whole system, we must also include the human part. That is at least one person technically capable of making a diagnosis of the problems and dealing with them when they occur, someone knowing what is possible to be achieved with the simulator and correctly advise the users in their research. In general, that person or the group of persons in charge of a DS must have not only the knowledge about the simulator itself but a good understanding of the goals of the research and how the simulator performs best in different scenarios. In most cases that knowledge comes from trial and error and becomes an accumulation of techniques applied to overcome difficulties such as simulator sickness, and lack of fidelity in the physical, visual, and other feedback given to the driver. It also includes building practical dynamic scenarios and dealing with many other operational issues that may exist. Each simulator has strengths and weaknesses; specific knowledge is always necessary to use or deal correctly with them. However, knowledge of another simulator's design and usage is highly recommended, and the persons in charge of a simulator should have the opportunities to study other simulators. This knowledge not only helps to make better use of the simulator, but it also gives useful indications on how to improve or upgrade an existing simulator architecture. To conclude on this point, when building or purchasing a new simulator, the human component of the system is"

In many cases, the goal of a simulator is to conduct research on and develop new vehicles or related technologies, new types of human- machine interface (HMI), or new mobility technologies. Such simulators include one or several hardware components as the subject of the research that are tested and developed with the simulator, then implemented in real vehicles for actual field tests. We call this system configuration HIL (hardware in the loop) as it incorporates actual vehicle components integrated with the other simulation elements. Typical hardware parts are electronic control units (ECUs), prototypes of pedal or steering systems, seats, and cockpit components such as monitors or head- up displays (HUDs) with their interactive systems, haptic or new types of feedback systems. The increase in research for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) pushes the standardization in interfacing simulators with vehicle components and simulator integrators to design simulators as the part of a vehicle."

Depending on the level of fidelity or customizability that is required, the scenario engine can also connect to specialized software solutions that will better respond to the requirements on one or several elements of the simulation. For instance, in Table 3.1, items 4 to 7 are often provided by the scenario engine, and 1, 2, and 8 can be part of specialized software. Items 9 and 10 often require the use of some piece of software that connects to the different measurement devices. Depending on the hardware of the simulator, items 12 and 13 may require some development. Still, some simulators, including standard plug- and- play equipment or those already linked with existing software programs, are also provided as integrated solutions. There is, in fact, no restriction on how to combine software elements. For instance, solutions specialized in simulating very high fidelity sound for the vehicle also exist. If the system must use individual components, a system integrator team or company is typically in charge of connecting all the parts and making sure the system works up to the functionality and performance requirements. As mentioned, fully integrated simulators or plug- and- play simulators also exist. They usually benefit from standard quality control and user support, and are comparatively less expensive than built ones, even with similar size and performances."

The standard supports test benches at all stages of the development and testing process - - most prominently model- in- the- loop (MIL), software- in- the- loop (SIL) and hardware- in- the- loop (HIL). The notation 'XIL' indicates that the standard can be used for all 'in- the- loop' systems. This has the advantage that it enables users to freely choose testing products according to their requirements and integrate them with little effort. Using ASAM XIL- compliant products allows users of test systems to mix and match the best components from different suppliers without having costly integration efforts."

A simulator has many hardware and software components or modules that carry out tasks at different rates or time steps. They generate a large amount of output data. Also, the output of one module becomes the input of the next module until it reaches its final form of light on screens, sound wave or movement, and vibrations. Also, ultimately, the original data is the time, pressure on pedals, and torque applied on the steering wheel by the driver, and other actions of the driver and operator of the simulator. It is possible to represent the entire system as a graph where each node is a module with input and output, and is working at its frequencies (Figure 3.1). One piece of software like the vehicle dynamics calculation or traffic simulation could contain thousands of nodes if we look at the system in a very high granularity. If every information must be kept, in case the data becomes necessary in the future, the original input to the system and the output of each node should be in the record. This approach is, unfortunately, not realistic at the moment as it would require too much processing and data storage."

Each module requires some time to process the data and generates an output. Data also is not immediately used by the next node in the chain due to transmission time and input frequencies of the node. In the end, time flows between the initial input and final output. All the data generated at one step of the simulation is not ready at the same timestamp. When data is collected, we should pay particular attention to understanding the data flow, when information is collected, or else, the causes- consequences order could be reversed, making any detailed or time- critical analysis impossible."

It would also be impossible for the driver to do the same actions exactly. Technically a replay function uses data collected at strategic positions in the data flow and replaces the work of the original modules by sending the recorded data to the following modules. For example, the reproduction of the visualization of the moving objects would require to save their position and orientation in the virtual environment at each frame initially rendered by the system. The position and orientation data would then be fed to the image generation software so it can be shown again on the screen. This simple replay function can be sufficient to explain to the driver where, for instance, he did not stop at intersections or drove too close to pedestrians in a narrow street."

Replaying data ensures that the test conditions are always the same, reduces the time a driver must be in the simulator, and finally helps to make consistent improvements economically. For instance, replaying data is used a lot in the development of sensor fusion algorithms, as acquiring real sensor data each time is not possible. But it can be used for less evident purposes like tuning a motion cueing algorithm (MCA) or debugging timing issues in a scenario."

The cockpit itself can be designed and built to incorporate the chosen components and sometimes ease the installation of cameras or other measurement devices. Such a cockpit can go further in improving the immersion by adding a roof, pillars, and other elements that provide a similar type of enclosure to a real cockpit. In general, immersive cockpits are designed as DS products and are produced more than once. However, some simulators for which it is important to convey the theme of the research can use some unique cabin design, as we can see in Figure 3.4."

The steering wheel, pedals, and other instruments must also be connected to the rest of the simulator to get the driving input information. For this purpose, most vehicles now include sensors and information that can be retrieved directly from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, but additional sensors might be necessary. The force feedback, especially crucial on the steering wheel, can be achieved using the steering power directly; knowledge and expertise on the vehicle are, however, necessary. Not only for the steering wheel power but also other parts, when it is not technically achievable to reuse them as it is, they are replaced in part or entirely by standard simulator components."

For simulators with large FOV, we often find a portion of or a full cylinder, sphere, or prism, sometimes used in combination with a floor screen. The immediate advantage is that there is no separation in the display surface, which allows generating an uninterrupted image. As a counterpart, geometrical correction of the image is mandatory, so that seen from the driver viewpoint, the scene is not distorted. Second, the projected images of two adjacent projectors overlap, but without any processing, so that the overlap band is twice as bright as other areas. The brightness correction that solves this problem is commonly called edge blending. The software that generates the image can be in charge of these transformations. That is also, in general, a less expensive solution. However, if the simulator must run with two or more different software solutions, it might be necessary to consider using a projection system that is able to deal with the geometrical and brightness corrections directly. So the often time- consuming setup and configuration of each software can be avoided."

As the motion system creates movement and physically modifies the reference position of the driver eyepoint, the viewpoint of the generated image must follow in real time the eyepoint reference. One method is to make the display system physically combined with the motion system. However, when the display system is independent and stationary as in Figure 3.7, the software must nullify the movement of the eyepoint relative to the display system in the final image. For this, data of the current eye reference position in the cockpit relative to the screens must be acquirable in real time. We develop more on this matter in Chapter 4."

They are compact and easily adaptable to any simulator, and they allow avoiding problems of complex multi- display systems while providing a large FOV. Usually worn on the user's head, HMDs can also be mounted on a helmet in case of aviation applications. In both cases, the HMD integrates a small LCD in front of one eye (monocular HMD) or a display in front of each eye (binocular HMD), which gives the user a sense of depth (Figure 3.8). Combined with a head- tracking device, it allows moving and rotating the camera in the virtual scene by replicating the motion of the user's head. The result is the illusion of the head moving in a virtual environment, resulting in a high degree of immersion."

An authentic instrument panel cluster can be used and connected to the simulation software to provide a realistic experience to the driver. However, using real clusters prevents from changing its design, and what and how the driver reads the information. When the flexibility on the design of the instrumentation is imperative, some configurations use LCDs, where the software generates a graphical representation of the instruments. It is possible in that case to adapt the look and feel of the cockpit of the vehicle and to conduct research on HMI on the in- cockpit display."

The simulation software uses the retrieved data, then reflects its value into the simulation. The system then gets the amount of torque that needs to be applied to the steering wheel of the simulator. The system can inject this value in the force- feedback control that generates torque on the hardware. How the system concretely calculates and uses that value to control the force of the steering wheel depends on the algorithm of the software application; the algorithm itself is sometimes the subject of study in the research. For general driving purposes, the software uses more or less complex mathematical models. The general process is to calculate the effect of the steering angle on the vehicle dynamics, then to determine the force that would occur on the steering shaft. That force comes principally from the reaction between the tire and the road surface. The power steering or power- assisted steering of the vehicle also modifies this force. In that case, the algorithm can be a fixed algorithm with some parameters that the user can change."

For instance, if the angle is encoded using 8 bits, 256 values can be encoded. For a steering wheel, it would be too low a value, and it would not be possible to control the direction of the vehicle with enough precision as it would require too many unnatural adjustments from the driver. Fortunately, nowadays, most steering wheel systems provide more than 10 or 12 bits precision with, respectively, 1 024 and 4 096 possible values. Above 12 bits, it becomes difficult to notice the difference while driving for casual drivers, and some systems provide even 16- bit signals. It is still imperative to understand that the resolution in the signal may not be the same as the physical resolution of the sensor. Because the logic is to select the number of bits so that there is no loss when encoding the real value into a digital one, the number of bits may be higher than what the sensor can truly measure."

Direct- drive systems are naturally heavier and more costly, but they get rid of every small disturbance coming from the gearbox. For instance, the micro gaps between gears can cause small drops in torque. The elasticity of the belts can generate wrong feedback too. The gearbox also is a component that, with time, wears out, and the discomfort can increase. About the motor itself, cogging is another important point for the quality of the steering wheel. Cogging is the irregularity in the torque due to static magnetic forces of the motor and other design and manufacturing quality. Finally, some natural friction exists and generates a resistive torque and damping when turning the wheel even if no electric current flows to the motor. Resistance must be as low as possible so that the feedback provided to the drivers comes primarily from the mathematical model of the software instead of forces that exist just from the mechanical parts of the device."

Theoretically, the torque generated on the steering wheel from the vehicle is the only input that the software should provide to the control unit of the motor. However, as it is the response of the car to the current angle of the steering wheel, it is naturally a closed- loop system where the frequency of the control loop becomes essential. The rate of the loop depends on how fast the software can calculate the feedback and communicate with the motor control unit. In many instances, some high- frequency responses cannot be correctly reproduced with only a direct torque control from the software. It becomes especially noticeable when the torque is almost null and, in worst cases, can also prevent the system from stabilizing at the wanted angle. Most steering wheel systems, to deal with these issues, provide additional control functions like generating extra friction and damping forces. The software then must mix these functions with the main torque control."

The difference between the movements perceived on the screen and physically is also a cause of motion sickness in simulators. Motion sickness highly reduces the active time drivers can spend in the simulator, which impacts on productivity and the achievements of the study or training. Additionally, motion cues play an essential role in the driver's judgment on how to steer the vehicle."

As a white- box approach, surveys are also often conducted, and well- designed questions provide valuable data by asking the driver directly what he felt, thought, and the reasons for what he did. However, when it is necessary to conduct a comparative study where the same driver has to go through several scenarios, surveying each run will very probably influence the driver for the next series. Switching patterns and 3D environments can help to ensure the driver reacts naturally to the situation instead of anticipating because of the questions. Still, it is time- consuming and can reduce the validity of the comparison. With few iterations, it might be possible to ask questions after all the runs, but after a time, the driver may forget what happened and won't be able to answer accurately."

However, specific stimulations trigger specific responses, which can be captured by brain imagery techniques. Unfortunately, it does not mean that one brain activity image always corresponds to the same cognitive process. Neural activity measurement in driver behavior research is often about comparative studies where a task is repeated several times with several persons to establish some reference measurements."

The experimental device made by Delabarre [14] consisted of attaching a \"harness\" directly onto an anesthetized eye. It was made of plaster material to naturally stick to the eye by itself and trimmed to fit cornea in shape and size. It also contained a hole of the size of the pupil, and a light thread attached the harness to a recording lever, allowing to record the horizontal and vertical movements of the eye onto a smoked surface of a kymograph cylinder. The system could track fairly well the eye movement, but it was limited to slow motion."

The combination of ECUs with a simulator enables to test most of the software logic; adding real sensors to the system helps improve the robustness of the final design. Because these tests are conducted in a simulator, the engineers can use many scenes and situations to assess the vehicle systems in a much more efficient way than using prototypes, which are onerous and time- consuming to build and use for tests."

It goes without explanation that the software must be able to take the driver's driving into account. Also, the mathematical representation of the vehicle dynamics should be as modular as possible with clear input and output specifications for each module. The modular approach enables the replacement of modules by new ones developed by engineers while using other modules as generic vehicle simulation. For research on ADAS, modularity is also necessary to connect necessary logical components or units throughout the mechanical process of the vehicle."

Simple vehicle dynamics descriptions often stop at what is necessary to calculate the vehicle movements; still, DS also need to give haptic feedback that includes the force felt from the steering wheel, pedals, and seat vibrations. From the simulation of the tires included in any physical models, we can directly derive the steering feedback force. It is less trivial to find models for pedal and vibration feedback in simulators, and they are often developed as additional features getting information from the primary vehicle simulation, without sending back their results into it. Nonetheless, they can be quite critical in some scenarios to give proper immersion and feedback to the driver."

In a simulator, it is imperative to integrate the vehicle model with the other elements of the environment. The interactions between the driver vehicle and other vehicles or other agents of the traffic are the primary goal. It provides a proper and realistic simulation of the surrounding, enabling not only research on driver's behavior but also ideal object sensing data of the traffic that is part of the ADAS input. In the scope of intelligent transportation systems or autonomous driving research, the integration of the main car into one whole traffic simulation also permits studies on communication between the vehicle and other elements of the environment such as other vehicles, pedestrians or elements of the infrastructure, often summarized in the term V2X communications, where V stands for Vehicle and X anything."

These models have a set of parameters that the user modifies to simulate the desired behavior. In cars, many elements act on the dynamics, and it takes advanced engineering skills to obtain a stable and performant result as a whole vehicle. It is the same for vehicle software simulation; the more advanced and precise is a model, the more difficult and time- consuming it is to tune. It is a necessary step for simulation focused on vehicle engineering; it is not or should not be a slow process when the focus is on the driver. We would recommend selecting the appropriate software solution or switch between solutions depending on the goal of the simulation."

Ideal data still takes into account the main characteristics of the sensor, such as the maximum sensing distance, the angular range of detection, light conditions, or obstruction by other objects. That way, the model can return what is supposed to be detected by real sensors. However, it is not possible to take into account noise, resolution, or errors that occur with real sensor data."

Algorithms for ADAS impact performance and safety, and testing them with a full extent of hardware precision error, noise, and failure is a crucial point for engineering them. Regarding sensors, first, there are precision errors by design that can be reasonably straightforward to model and simulate. If we take the example of a pre- crash system using object distance information retrieved from image processing of a stereo camera, the sensor is limited in the precision in which it can capture the distance of objects. By design, the pixel resolution, FOV, and spacing between both cameras are the essential factors that set the precision of the sensor. From this information, a simple equation gives the error range depending on the distance of the object. A simple way to simulate that error would be to add a random value generated within the calculated error range. But, other precision loss or failure to measure a distance can occur because of the limitations of the program that analyzes the stereo image. For instance, a simple stereo image processing is sensitive to reflections, lack of contrast, or lack of color change in the image. Errors and failure patterns must be analyzed and modeled to be simulated meaningfully, and sometimes it is simpler to take the physically based approach. In that case, the physical approach would be to simulate the raw data stream of the stereo camera and use that data with the actual image processing algorithm. In that case, the challenge shifts from simulating the final results of the sensor to creating photo- realist computer graphics."

For ADAS, radar systems have been improved and specialized for the automotive industry. A transmitter sends a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW), as the name says, continuously. The receiver also functions continuously. The time to receive the emitted wave, its frequency modified by Doppler effect, and the direction from which the wave returns are used to determine objects' distance, velocity, and position relative to the sensor, respectively. The intensity of the wave can also provide information on the material on which the wave is reflected. Still, radars have the most difficulty in classifying objects as waves mainly bounce on metallic materials."

The driving environment is built on a computer in 3D, and vehicle simulation is performed in the environment. Also, the output of the visual information to the driver is generated from the 3D environment on the computer. Therefore, as a requirement of the 3D environment in the DS, it must be possible to obtain sufficient information to perform vehicle simulation from the 3D environment, and sufficient peripheral environment as visual information to the driver. The flow of the traffic environment and the rendering of its image is also necessary. Table 3.2 includes examples of the elements of the 3D environment required by the DS. Depending on the purpose of the DS, in some cases, more items may be necessary, and in other cases, some items may not be."

It is necessary to perform the vehicle simulation and simulate the surrounding traffic vehicles; it is also a critical element as visual information to the driver. For the reproduction of a real road in a virtual road environment, it is necessary to be able to reproduce the road without limiting it to a single road with a constant cross section. We must also reproduce the changes of different cross sections, intersections of roads, change in the number of lanes, crossing lanes in intersections, and on- ramp and off- ramp connections. Figure 3.20 shows the underlying lane network information in green that is used to control the simulation. Moreover, it is necessary to be able to perform traffic control using traffic signals and a variety of traffic regulations. Let us think about what information we need from these road elements for each function of the simulation."

On the other hand, it provides consistent traffic behavior as the vehicle flow in parts of the network influences other parts, thus simulates congestions as they would appear spontaneously in real life."

It would require too much computing power to perform the simulation with the same accuracy as the simulation of the driving vehicle, so traffic simulation is often performed with less sophisticated vehicle dynamic models. However, using too simplified models may incur unnatural car movements that disturb the driver or create unwanted results for ADAS researches. Simple PID (proportional- integral- derivative) algorithms for lane following and speed control, associated with simple bicycle dynamics, provide relatively convincing vehicle movements."

However, the reproducibility of a scenario is difficult to ensure because it can depend on the actions of the driver. For instance, how to ensure the driver has to pay attention to a specific car in an intersection if the driver decides to drive slowly and that the conflicting vehicle has already passed the intersection. We can partially solve this problem by giving instructions to the driver, but when they become too complicated or require exact timing, it is not possible to reproduce a scenario."

The second approach has the advantage of reducing the work and number of possible errors for the instructor, allowing him to focus on other tasks such as communicating with the driver or monitoring additional and relevant information. Programmable conditions can also be configurable and slightly changed between two runs, for instance, allowing the researcher to conduct comparative experiments accurately and reliably. The drawback is that some conditions can be challenging to define programmatically.

Based on the information provided by the auditory system, the brain can estimate if an object emitting sound is close or far, and infer its speed and direction when it is moving in the environment. It provides valuable auditory cues that reinforce the reliability of the motion perception [27], particularly in the case of translational motion, for which the auditory sense helps perceive the direction of motion [28]."

Indeed, in an ideal world, if physical feedback if fully reproduced, the second and third goals are also achieved. On the other hand, Bos [48] showed that high- frequency vibrations applied to the head could help reduce motion sickness in some cases without even reproducing the actual vibration of the vehicle. Lucas et al. [49] still show that there is a possibility of better results when vibrations are consistent with the dynamics of the vehicle. In any case, the driver does not feel longitudinal vehicle accelerations, but still, the motion sickness can be reduced under some conditions."

However, each one can be implemented differently or use more or less accurate models of the system, and different ways of tuning or optimizing parameters. The four main types of algorithms are as follows:"

As we have seen, human movement perception comes from many stimuli, and we use motion platforms to stimulate the inner ear and the proprioception. We saw that the vestibular sense feels rotation speeds and accelerations while mainly only feeling accelerations of linear movements. The algorithm tries to provide the best linear acceleration cues and rotational cues. We must notice that it is a chance we do not feel linear speed because it would not be possible to reproduce them in a limited space. In turn, rotations of the yaw angle in the horizontal plane can be relatively long, so if feeling them becomes necessary for the research, a turntable can be added.

The first thing that an MCA must provide is the onset cues when the vehicle starts a new movement, which means a change in acceleration or non- null jerk. For this, the platform must accelerate in the same direction as the vehicle does but still has to stop, so it does not reach its physical limits. A Stewart platform only provides few centimeters or few decimeters of movement in general, so clearly, the platform has to stop very soon after reproducing an onset cue. By chance, we feel gravity as acceleration with the vestibular system, and proprioception through the pressure change on the back of the seat. Using that fact, we can use tilt coordination to create an angle with the horizontal, so gravity applies a force in the horizontal direction relative to the vehicle reference. While tilting is activated and provides the feel of linear acceleration for a time as long as desired, the platform can return to a more centered position so it can provide future linear accelerations again. About tilting, we must remember that the ideal center of rotation is the head of the driver, while vehicle rotations should be applied at the vehicle rotation center. Let us now decompose the process in phases and see where problems occur and what the algorithm must solve."

If the platform is kept within that range, it can adapt its posture to the yaw angle of the turntable. We must still consider that even if the driver does not feel this adaption movement of the angle, it requires actual movements from the platform. It is using a part of its acceleration and speed capacity for changing its posture instead of providing cues to the driver. If we take that into account, the yaw table should be tuned to avoid very fast rotations."

In reality, the actuators of the 6- DOF platform are coupled. When actuators are at the maximum position in X, for instance, it is not possible to do more vertical movement without moving back the platform toward its center. When addressing that issue in the tuning process, the only way to ensure the platform does not exceed its limitation is to be conservative. In these conditions, it is not possible to exploit the platform to its maximum potential when the vehicle movements are not in the worst- case scenario."

In our case, the criterion is to reduce a cost that takes into account the error of the output compared to the ideal solution, and other cost components that penalize the system if it does not respect certain constraints. With MCAs, the cost is based on the driver feedback error and to what extent the system functions within its performance limitations."

On the other hand, some of them are not appropriate for real- time driving simulation. Also, all the techniques we have found use a perception model based on the human vestibular system only. The sensation error of proprioception, for instance, is not included in the cost function, and the final tuning somehow stays dependent on subjective judgment. It must also address opinions coming from the drivers. Adding the fact that tuning still relies on trial and error on how to set up the weight matrices, which is less natural than tuning the parameters of the classical algorithm, it would be difficult to conclude which approach to choose in general."

The classical algorithm and optimum algorithms presented so far work with linear accelerations and rotations in a classical surge/sway/heave and yaw/pitch/roll 6- DOF approach. But depending on the design of the motion system, some DOF could be coupled. For instance, if surge and sway movements are, when the motion system executes some movement on the surge axis, it automatically reduces the maximum acceleration, speed, and excursion that can be delivered on the sway axis. Depending on the design of the hardware, the coupling can be more or less important. For instance, all 6- DOF are on a Stewart platform."

We saw that one significant optimization of motion cueing comes from improving the tilt coordination. If the system only responds to the current vehicle data input, it can only react from that point and start tilting from after the acceleration of the vehicle started. If a future acceleration is predictable, it is possible to start the tilting movement earlier, while canceling the false acceleration with linear movements, then providing acceleration cues when they arrive in the input. This method requires accurate prediction, so the synchronization with the acceleration change is optimal. Otherwise, a wrong specific force would be felt due to too early tilting. Another way to use prediction is simply to move the system near the opposite excursion limit of the one that would force to stop the linear acceleration generated by the simulation. In any case, the preparation of the motion system for the next acceleration must be done under the perception threshold of the driver, requiring a prediction of several seconds."

In terms of control theory, MPC (Model Prediction Control) is often implemented as an optimal cueing algorithm based on offline optimization using a recorded simulation run. This technique is not recent, but we would recommend that the reader refers to Grottoli et al. [57]. They explain very well the advantage of that methodology compared to a standard approach. Of course, that method relies on recorded data and is not applicable for real- time driving simulation. An overview of the research shows that traditionally, the calculation necessary to optimize motion is very demanding in computer power, so even if the data were known in advance, it would not be achievable to use such algorithms in real time. To solve that issue Beghi et al. [58] show how to use an advanced technique to lower the calculation cost so the algorithm could run in real time, but the method still relies on accurate knowledge of the vehicle movement of the whole simulation. Mohammadi et al. [59] propose a method to stabilize an MPC with only a short prediction horizon instead of using a large time frame or the whole record of the drive. This approach improves the performances of the algorithm, but here again, the issue of real- time simulation remains."

When virtual reality started to become more affordable and available on standard computers, we saw the rapid extent of video games and entertainment systems, making use of simulation and VR technology. Then other fields like architecture, construction, manufacturing and maintenance training, marketing, art, education, and many others also use VR as a way to convey information, sensation, and understanding to users. Virtual reality evolves as the different areas using it require new features and performances. It makes no doubt that driving simulation, as one of the first fields using VR, played a role in pushing the technology. It would be difficult to establish precise interactions between VR and driving simulation and say which played which role in influencing the other. However, we can fairly assume that one evident impact of the multidisciplinary of VR on DSs is that they are now used also for traffic planning and research, road design, maintenance, road safety research, and training [61]."

The driving was automatically assessed to give immediate feedback to the driver on his performance, and the data was recorded for further analysis to improve road safety on highways.

The first tools for traffic planning were developed to estimate the volume of traffic on each link of a road network but could not show the movement of each vehicle or not with enough precision. With the advance in computer power and parallel computing, these tools evolved and now can simulate individual vehicle movements into what is known as microsimulation. Software providers, from that point, worked to integrate traffic and driving simulation into one simulation environment, knowing that it would help to solve the issue of bringing, in simulation, the user into the road and transport system. In that evolution, VR plays the role of integrating both expertise into one integrated solution. It adds better traffic simulation to DS but also brought DS technology to transport research, development, and training [62]."

As for material, wood, plastic, glass, or leather, look like the originals, and it is possible to take advantage of real- time PBR for cockpit design and even marketing purposes. From a more technical point of view, it is also possible to accurately represent some cockpit interfaces such as HUDs where light emission and reflection are critical."

As an example, Mercedes presented in the CES 2015 a futuristic concept car using displays instead transparent glass for windows. While this concept has a taste of science fiction, it clearly shows the interest of presenting augmented information to the driver and passengers. Nowadays, HUDs have already implemented this concept to some extent by presenting navigation or other contextual information to the driver, but let us ask ourselves first what the goal of integrating XR technology in vehicles is."

From that angle, there exists a tight relationship between the evolution of cars in a new environment and XR technologies that possess the potential to entertain, teach, or even help passengers discovering new things. For instance, the system could show information that is normally invisible from the vehicle, or, on the contrary, replace non- essential elements and remove visual pollution. We can also imagine a system that presents practical information on a location, or historical and cultural content about a particular place, street, or monument. We must also mention that this prospect is supported by the general progress of VR on smart devices, which at the same time helps the development of VR on embedded hardware that we can use in vehicles. This new perspective is an evolution that benefits from the progress of independent technologies such as XR, machine learning, autonomous driving, and HMI, that interconnect through the automotive industry. It is still difficult to predict how cockpits will look like in the future. Still, we could also say that this situation is very similar to the relationship that existed between DS and VR in the beginning. Such interactions between fields of engineering have significant potential, and DS could be the catalytic element."

Bust, as we saw, the advance in VR and visual rendering with PBR allows simulating light in a better way than it was done before. Because a physical value can be retrieved from the simulation, VR can not only generate better photorealistic images, it can also simulate infrared or LiDAR sensor data, and provide information very close to real sensors. We could discuss the accuracy of the data that is not ideal in the real world, but it is also possible to some extent to simulate noise or inaccurate measurements to simulated data and provide even closer results."

Because of the limitations of computer hardware, performance requirements, and the need for easiness of data creation, many techniques have been developed historically. A large part of the techniques developed for driving simulator comes from the computer game market, virtual reality, and computer graphics for general content creation. In this chapter, we describe recent techniques used in computer graphics, why, and how we use them in simulations."

The content of the image and how the driver perceives it indeed affects the driving performance. In a simulator, we want the driver to behave as close as possible to driving in reality. For this, we can immediately conclude that contrary to video games or movies, the content of the computer graphics is not made to impress the viewer, it should not add exaggerated visual effects that may distract the driver. On the other hand, we could say that it is more important to provide high resolution, contrast, and brightness than in other cases where the visual content can still be enjoyable without high- end hardware performances. Here we do not want to minimize the importance of proper hardware for entertainment, and we could even argue that most hardware developments were made thanks to this market. However, as we want to reproduce the driver's behavior, the physical reproduction of light by the display hardware can be crucial for simulators."

A fragment can be seen basically as a pixel on the screen or in the image buffer. It can be visible or obstructed by another fragment. It is important to note that while the computer performs shading for each fragment, material attributes are only stored for each vertex. This helps tremendously to reduce memory use but, in some cases, falls short of providing enough information to represent complex materials. In such cases, textures are used, so that every fragment can have different material properties. It is also possible to use several textures to refine the material even further."

These three types of colors have been used because it dramatically reduces the number of calculations to be made, which was a necessity when 3D rendering became mainstream several decades ago. But they are not suited to describe a material accurately. For example, the visible color of gold is yellow, but what about its reflection color? The answer to that question is that the reflection color of gold (or any other material) depends on the light condition, which proves the limitations of standard materials."

One of the main benefits of using physically based materials is that describing them is done using real and measurable properties, like the metal content or the smoothness. This description method can significantly accelerate the data creation and ensure the accuracy of the materials, regardless of the lighting conditions. Of course, using physically based materials requires a physically based rendering approach (as explained in Section 2.3.2), which means the software must implement a shading model for each type of material, for instance, metals, glass, and water. Implementing those models is time- consuming at first, but results in a way more accurate output and does not necessarily slow down the rendering process. In the context of a simulator that would be used to evaluate human- machine interfaces, the accuracy of the material surfaces is paramount. Therefore, physically based materials and rendering is a necessity. For a better understanding Figure 4.2 shows a range of material properties affecting the reflection of light on the surface of the object."

A single sky texture has to be 360 degrees, so it is usually composed of many photos combined, and many sky textures should be available to represent various weather conditions, time of the day, and latitudes. This technique results in only a limited set of conditions that can be represented and therefore tested in simulations, which is not ideal."

Since then, a better model has been developed known as the Hosek- Wilkie model at the University of Prague. It uses actual color measurements which makes it even more realistic and, more importantly, can be used to represent the sky at any latitude. It could even be used to represent the sky of extraterrestrial worlds, should that become a requirement for an autonomous driving simulator. The implementation is not overcomplicated (many implementations are available online), so it quickly became the most used model in modern simulators or games. In more recent years, some updates included the solar radiance evaluation to be able to draw the sun disc accurately, as well as other improvements, most of which are accessible online on freely accessible repositories. Figure 4.4 shows the sky rendered with variety of parameters (vertical axis) at different hours of the same day (horizontal axis) using the Preetham model."

However, the sky model by itself is probably not enough to provide a good representation of the sky. Clouds, stars at night as well as any other object present in the sky, such as plane trails, should also be rendered to obtain a very realistic sky representation. We should note that the sky representation is not only crucial for drawing the sky itself; it also plays a critical role in the light calculations performed during shading."

Light beam data is usually found in the form of a photometric data file. IES and EULUMDAT are the main file formats. These files contain candela information, where candela is the luminous power per unit solid angle, emitted by a point source. For a specific light source, candela data is given for each direction of interest, in which the source emits light. More candela measurement points provide a higher resolution of the light beam patterns; therefore, a more accurate representation of the light. To provide the perceived color of an object, we must calculate the amount of light reflected by it. When calculating the reflection at a particular point, we calculate the direction from which light arrives and the intensity of this light. The direction is known from the relative position of the point and the light source. Once the direction is known, it is possible to use the candela information to calculate the amount of light arriving at the point. If candela information is available for that direction, the software can use it as is. Otherwise, an interpolation from the nearest available data provides an estimate."

Some lamps have a dynamic beam pattern, as in matrix- led headlight or pixel laser LED to turn on or off, or dim light only in specific angles of the pattern. In that case, the matrix representation of the beam must be updated dynamically during the simulation. There are several possible methods to implement such lamps. The resulting pattern could be recalculated and resent to the shader program each time it is modified. If the control resolution of the beam pattern is not as high as the actual lighting pattern resolution, it is possible only to send the beam control data and let the shader recalculate the pattern on the fly. When it can be applied, this method is preferable because it requires sending smaller data to the shader when the pattern is modified."

However, it is not possible or very complicated to define details such as road bumps or holes in the road surface. Irregularities in the road surface can be very difficult to describe mathematically, and their shapes do not always depend on the station and offset coordinates. We can add bumps and other asperities to the procedural model as patches that applies a modification to the road surface. These patches are small TIN meshes or height maps stored in a grid format and reused at different positions on the road. For instance, bridges joints, maintenance holes, and potholes can be represented that way with a reasonable"

That issue necessitates deciding whether to allow driving on other surfaces and dealing with the boundary of the carriageway. When allowing driving outside the limit of the definition of the road, the software must pass some default ground surface information to the vehicle simulation algorithm. A method is to generate a 3D mesh wide enough around the definition of the road. It is also possible to extrapolate the defined road surface outside its boundary. However, this method can be arduous to apply in curves in a nonhorizontal road as it requires complex methods to ensure providing a smooth and continuous surface."

Each rendered fragment belongs to a layer where layers are split of the space in the depth direction.

This method has the advantage of using the GPU instead of the CPU for sorting elements of the scene."

To solve that problem, vegetation, especially leaves, are represented with few polygons where each polygon has a texture showing many leaves and possibly branches.

Figure 4.12 shows a tree where the mask is applied on the branches and leaves on the left side, and not applied on the right side."

In the original texture, if masked pixels are black, in the lower resolution versions of the mipmap, neighboring pixels are mixed with the masked black pixels. If mixed pixels include more nonmasked polygons than masked ones, the pixel is visible, thus showing a darker pixel than intended. We can avoid this problem by customizing the mipmap resizing process and not take into account pixels initially masked. Another solution is to use a similar color for masked pixels than non- masked ones that are in proximity."

Simple simulation is often enough as the goal is not to really simulate refraction but only the effect of refraction. We can simplify the process by blending the surface color with a fragment that already exists in the scene. For each fragment, a refraction vector is calculated using its position and normal. The fragment to blend from the pre- rendered scene is selected using that vector. In reality, the light may"

It may have been the case before, or maybe because computers were not powerful enough, no real attention was put to it. But now it is possible, and real- time rendering of transparent surfaces can push forward the development of HMIs or cockpits that rely on this type of material. Another critical aspect is the information a driver gets through the windows of other vehicles or buildings. How many did we anticipate braking times by looking, through the windows of the vehicle immediately in front, at the brake lamps of vehicles further ahead? With Figure 4.14 that shows how the driving scene looks like with transparent car windows, we clearly see that it is possible to look at the brake lamp of the car in front."

Therefore, the rendering time is highly dependent on the number of vertices used in the scene and the number of pixels of the screen. The surface of the road, for instance, in reality, is made of many asperities visible from the driver's point of view. We see it in the form of shadows and change in color that give the grain of the surface. It would demand too much from the GPU to store all the vertices and render the geometry of the asperities and other irregularities of the road only using a geometrical definition. With regards to geometrical details, depending on the desired level of detail, significant parts of objects shape are represented with polygons and some surfaces that can be considered flat and defined with only one polygon. Surfaces defined flat, but that, in reality, include visible geometrical details and color patterns use texturing to represent them.Also, already explained about the modeling of trees and vegetation, masking is another method to simplify shape definitions while representing complex ones. Figure 4.15 shows an example where the truss beams of the bridge and mesh of the fence are only using a flat polygon but making it look like a much more complex geometry."

Normal mapping is used to describe bumps and dents in the surface, which is used to alter the light reflections and refractions, resulting in a way more appealing output while drastically reducing the number of vertices, which reduces memory use. For example, describing the nerves of leather in a car seat would require millions of vertices, making the model too big to fit in memory and very slow to render. With normal mapping represented in Figures 4.16 and 4.17, the vertices only describe the general shape of the car seat, and a single repeating texture describes the nerves of the leather. The memory use is significantly reduced, and such a model can be rendered in real time."

However, parts that usually receive less light than others, whatever the position of the sun, should appear darker. In real- time applications, ambient occlusion (SSAO and SSDO) is the most common technique to simulate that effect. Still, it is somewhat time- consuming on the GPU and lacks precision in some cases so that baking textures (Figure 4.18) can be a preferred method. Baking also allows for creating textures of complex objects while using only a simplified geometry for the real- time application."

When it is far from the viewpoint, such details are not necessary. Here, close and far can be defined as the angle of the field of view that is covered by the object on the screen (view angle). Objects close to the viewpoint have a larger view angle than far ones. If an object is modeled in multiple levels of details (LOD) as shown in Figure 4.19, it is possible to switch from one level to another when the distance of the object changes. Using a lower level of detail permits drawing more objects in the scene while keeping the load of GPU in an acceptable range. It is essential to notice that as the distance from the viewpoint increases, potentially more objects become visible in the scene. So not using different levels of details efficiently may force the user to reduce the maximum viewing distance during the simulation.HighFigure 4.19 LOD conceptual diagram"

In a particle system, each particle follows its movement and is rendered as one element. All particles of one system follow some rules and are rendered similarly. Particles often have an initial state partially randomized, then evolve during a given lifetime. A particle can have multiple attributes that store its current status and modified each time the particle is updated. These attributes are also used when rendering the particle. Even if all particles follow the same basic rules, because the generation parameters and the environment in which they evolve differs, it is possible to simulate and visualize complex phenomena."

Rain and snow are a typical use of particle systems in simulators. For special scenarios involving accidents or extreme weather conditions, fire, fumes, or concentration of fog reducing visibility, it is relatively straightforward to simulate them with particles (Figure 4.21). In that case, particles are often rendered as sprites with some transparency. We previously explained that semi- transparent polygons should be rendered with some sorting algorithm. For smoke, it is possible to simplify the algorithm to use a large amount of particle without lowering the rendering time. As long as a unique color is used for the sprites, it is not a problem to draw them in a random order as the final blended color stays the same. However, the problem persists if they must be mixed with other transparent objects such as windows."

Ray- tracing allows for creating a reflection of any object in any shape. The latest generation of GPUs provides real- time ray- tracing pipelines, but the rendering time is still slower and perfect reflections may not be necessary for driving simulation. Without ray- tracing, it is possible to represent an accurate reflection on flat surfaces by rendering the reflected image in a temporary buffer, then use that buffer as a texture mapped on the reflecting surface. With some adaptation, this technique is also applicable for almost flat surfaces such as a road surface, water, or slightly curved mirrors."

A mirror view of the scene is calculated by rendering from the mirrored viewpoint by applying global space transformation to the scene. Once the reflected image is saved to a frame buffer, we use it to calculate the color of the reflecting surface (Figure 4.24). In the case of water, the surface is not perfectly flat but presents waves. Instead of using a simple linear mapping of the mirrored image, we calculate a reflection vector for each pixel of the water surface, from which the corresponding reflected fragment of the frame buffer can be determined. We calculate the reflection vector by looking at the normal of the surface at the reflection point. In the case of water, we can generate the normal value from standard wave generation equations."

But in that case, instead of rendering a mirrored scene into a separated frame buffer, we can simply use the main frame buffer data. The idea is to re- render each pixel of the screen once. This time a refraction vector is calculated instead of a reflection vector. The light coming from outside the vehicle is indeed passing through a layer of water that has nonparallel air- water and water- glass interfaces. Due to refraction, we see a distorted image from inside the vehicle. We can assume that from the windshield, most of the arriving light, even with refraction, mainly comes from the scene already rendered before distortion."

Depending on how realistically the refraction vector is calculated, this technique can provide very good results when the experiment, for instance, requires to simulate reduced visibility in rainy scenarios. Compared to a reflection, the processing is quite fast since it only requires recalculating the color of each pixel of the screen. We can also simulate the reflection of light sources on the water layer, providing an even more realistic rainy scene at night where many street lights and vehicle headlights hit the windshield of the vehicle."

Shading tries to approximate local behavior of light on the object's surface and is not to be confused with techniques of adding shadows, such as shadow mapping or shadow volumes, which fall under global behavior of light.\" This explanation makes perfect sense because what shading makes in computer graphics is what a painter does by darkening the edges of an object on a painting to create some depth effect while being only painted on a 2D canvas."

The whole right of the car is more illuminated than other sides because the surface normal is oriented towards the sun (diffuse component). The right doors of the car are brightly highlighted because the surface orientation makes the light emitted by the sun being reflected directly at the camera (specular component). However, this does not explain the front of the car, which is visible while being oriented oppositely to the sun (using only direct lightning; this part would be completely black). With global illumination, any object is illuminated from the surroundings. In this particular case, the sky in front of the car (and behind the viewpoint) illuminates the front of the car. That part of the sky is probably darker than areas next to the sun, resulting in a darker illumination. We want to clarify the fact that global illumination does not modify the Phong illumination model in any way as the calculations of the diffuse and specular components do not change. Still, the light is like a sphere surrounding objects and not a single point, resulting in, as can be seen in Figure 4.28, very realistic representations of objects."

Discrete light sources include any human- made light (streetlights, headlights, the various lights found in rooms, and any other light source). Most discrete light sources are positioned at a precise point within the scene, and light attenuation has only an effect on surrounding objects. Many types of discrete lights can be implemented depending on the light shape and direction. The following are a few common examples."

The reason behind the need for separate shading models for each material type is that most of these shading models employ the use of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is a function that defines how light is reflected on a given material type. Essentially most metallic materials reflect the light in the same way, so the same BRDF is used. On the other hand, glass reflects light very differently, so the same BRDF is probably not adequate, and"

For example, a new car is well polished, and roughness might be close to 0. After some years, some areas might be more worn out than others, effectively becoming rougher: it is easy using a texture to adjust the roughness of the material in certain areas only. Figure 4.33 shows a vehicle rendered using a metallic- roughness model where we can see the left side of the car (on the right in the image) with a brighter reflection than the front of the car. The resulting image in Figure 4.33 accurately reproduces the fact that the light coming from the environment from the right of the viewpoint is brighter than the light coming from behind the viewpoint."

For example, the surface of a car is a combination of the metal paint itself, the wax applied over it, and any dust or dirt that is sticking to it. In such a case, we can apply multimaterial rendering techniques, also called material layering. In that case, each material of the surface is rendered, then the results are combined using coefficients in the final color. These coefficients are usually provided by textures so that they can vary over the surface. In our example, the bottom parts of the car are likely to collect more dust. The dust coefficient would be higher at those locations."

For reference, the brightest video projectors today can reach several tens of thousands of lumens.

HDR rendering ensures that light is simulated accurately. But since inputs and intermediary calculations are unbounded, the question becomes: how to \"fit\" the result within the bounds that the display equipment can accept? We use tone mapping to solve that issue. Concretely we use a curve to define, for an unbounded input, a corresponding bounded value. There have been many kinds of research conducted on the subject of tone mapping, and many algorithms have been extensively used by games and movies (Reinhard, ACES, etc.). One thing to remember about tone mapping is that there is no \"best\" or \"most accurate\" tone mapping. The process of tone mapping is inherently subjective. It should be adjusted to particular display equipment and purpose. For instance, some movies tend to be very dark while games aimed at kids are brighter and have vivid colors.

In addition to the time necessary to transfer the data mentioned earlier, when the amount of data exceeds the capacity of the GPU memory, a part of the data goes to the main memory. From this point, swapping of data between the two types of memories frequently occurs, resulting in poor rendering times, not acceptable for driving simulators."

Recently, the use of parallel computing capabilities other than for graphics has also advanced, such as artificial intelligence and numerical computing. Due to the characteristics of the hardware, some processes are considered unsuitable for GPUs, such as conditional branching. For nonintegrated GPUs, the GPU and CPU communicate through a high- speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) connection. Although, even if fast, that data communication can be a bottleneck in some situations described later in this chapter."

Intel with the Intel HD Graphics product and AMD with the Ryzen product both provide integrated GPUs. In integrated solutions, the CPU and GPU share the same memory, which can lower the performances. The GPU is also less performant than what stand- alone GPUs can deliver. We would not recommend using an integrated solution for research simulators now. However, integrated solutions saw a fast improvement in performance in the past few years, so the previous statement may not be accurate in the future. NVIDIA and AMD both make consumer and professional solutions for GPUs, and both are very high- performance products. Table 4.2 lists major products, where consumer products are the GeForce for NVIDIA and Radeon for AMD, and professional products are the NVIDIA Quadro and AMD Radeon Pro or FirePro."

In some scenarios, low- end GPUs can be enough. Still, the system would be limited in the amount of complexity of the scene, and mostly not usable if you think about using stereoscopic vision. It is also essential to consider that GPUs with less memory have to rely more on the computer's main memory and data transfer between the CPU and GPU. As explained earlier, this would result in stuttering in the image flow. This effect can negatively impact the driver and the result of the experiment or training. Considering these points, we would recommend choosing high- end or near high- end products for serious simulators."

The first one is to ensure that all image buffers are sent from the computers, at precisely the same time, to all the display devices. As we saw in the GPU hardware descriptions, only professional solutions provide such feature. It is necessary when active stereo display is one requirement of the system. It is also necessary to reduce tearing artifacts and inconsistent delays among display devices. However, these last two problems cannot be solved only at a hardware level. The image generation software must also ensure that all images sent to the GPU correspond to the same timestamp of the simulation. Synchronization is essentially a problem when we use multiple computers to generate the images, so let us study the solution for synchronization between several computers."

The center computer calculates the content of the simulation and sends it every frame to the IG (image generators) computers (Message Nb. 1). The IGs then render the content of the image according to the latest simulation data and then send the image buffer to the display hardware (Message Nb. 5). For synchronization, the timing at which the image buffer is sent to the display hardware and the simulation data used to generate the images must be the same. That is why some synchronization control is necessary."

In that case, how to ensure that all the image buffers represent the same instant of the simulation? For this, we use a software frame synchronization or frame lock mechanism. Figure 4.41 shows that process with messages 2 and 3. Message 2 indicates to the central PC when all IGs have finished rendering their part of the scene. After sending message 2, IGs wait for message 3 before asking the GPU to send the image to the display hardware. In the proposed sequence, message 3 is sent by the central computer after receiving all the messages 2 from the IGs. This method ensures that all IGs send the same simulation content to the screens."

Because messages 3 and 4 come from different sources, message 3 may arrive after message 4 for some machines. These machines would then send the image buffer one frame later than the others. We could solve that issue by adding more control in the synchronization. However, more control requires more messages or higher thresholds, which reduce the available time for rendering the scene. In a driving simulator, we want to achieve a stable and high frame rate, so it is preferable to prioritize the time available to render the scene.

The data is sent over some kind of network (most often Ethernet) between computers, so any congestion on the network can profoundly affect the performances of the system, add delay or different response time between computers. So it is imperative to ensure the local network is stable and performant. The connection between the computers and the display hardware is another area that can impact the system. In large simulators, there is often a long distance between the computers and the display devices. The amount of data that must be sent does not allow for long HDMI or Display port cables, and some sort of signal amplification or conversion to a more stable medium such as LAN cables or optic fibers is necessary. This type of connection adds more intermediate devices on the link, which then becomes more prone to connection problems. Selecting suitable quality devices and cables, plus ensuring the installation is clean and not affected by electromagnetic fields generated by power cables, for instance, is important."

The corneal reflection method is to measure eye movements from the reflected image of the cornea, using a light source such as an LED. For example, when an experiment participant has poor eyesight and regularly wears eyeglasses, the reflected image cannot be detected sometimes, because the light illuminating the cornea changes due to the characteristics of the eyeglass lens when irradiating LED light through glasses."

The time from the presentation of the stimulus to the response is defined as the response time, and the stimulus is called the trigger signal. As a taskthat examines the response time, there are simple response tasks that look at the single response for the single stimulation and selection response task that chooses from multiple alternatives according to the content of the stimulation. As the number of stimuli and alternatives increases, the response time increases, and according to Hick's law, the response time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of alternatives "

For example, the response time is shorter when the right button is pressed with the right stimulus, and longer when the left button is pressed with the right stimulus. In the case of the selective response, the response time differs according to the appearance probability of the stimulation. The higher the frequency of appearance, the shorter the response time, and the lower the frequency, the longer the response time."

The brain activity generates weak electrical signals along with the activity, which are measured to clarify the features of the brain activity by analyzing its characteristics. Brain waves were discovered in 1929 by German psychiatrist and neurologist Hans Berger. Since then, the research and development of an electroencephalograph (EEG) have progressed. The EEG has been developed using vacuum tubes or transistors and microcomputers, and is mainly used as a medical device [5]."

For example, in level 3 of the autonomous driving systems, normal driving is performed by a vehicle, that is, by an autonomous driving system, but when a situation that cannot be handled by a vehicle occurs, the driver needs to take full control of the vehicle."

Theta waves are observed in a state of light sleep or decreased consciousness. Alpha waves are observed in a calm and relaxed state and are classified into three types: slow for a rested state, mid for a relaxed state, and fast for a nervous state. Beta waves are observed in the state of the cerebrum being active due to tension or anxiety.

From around 1980, it became possible to observe the activity of the brain in real time by the development of the neural function image technology, and techniques such as positron emission computed tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been developed [6]. However, the equipment necessary for these methods was very expensive, the measurement and signal analysis were complicated, and the utilization in DS was difficult. In such a situation, the medical equipment manufacturer of Japan developed multichannel NIRS that could measure the relative blood flow change of the brain in proportion to the brain position."

Pulse waves can be measured from the fingertips or earlobes and can be considered close to, although not strictly, HR.

Pulse wave amplitude may also be decreased at the fingertips and increased in the earlobes. This is because blood vessels constrict in the fingertips and dilate in the head when a steady reflex occurs. This is a mechanism of the body to send more blood flow to the brain and to understand new information."

It is because the response time differs depending on whether the response is started from the state of placing the foot on the floor, placing the foot on the pedal, or stepping on the pedal a little. Therefore, when the response time measurement results are shown, the start and end points must be accurately described. Time headway (THW: distance between vehicles divided by own vehicle speed) and time to collision (TTC: distance between cars divided by relative speed) are typical inter- vehicle distance and inter- vehicle time which show spatial margin between own vehicle and preceding vehicle. It is said that THW represents the driver's sense of rear- end collision risk in the situation with small speed fluctuation. On TTC, it is said that the driver judges the brake start based on the reciprocal of TTC. The relation between THW and TTC is examined, and the time derivative value of TTC and secondary prediction value of TTC are also proposed. The driving performance in the anteroposterior direction is still to be examined."

Although some other methods use the lateral position for the travel lane other than the SE method, they require an on- vehicle camera. The SE method does not require additional equipment; therefore it is superior and is said to have high sensitivity. Not only there is SE method but also there are other methods to analyze the frequency of steering input and switching frequency of steering.

The SE records all driving data and calculates the PE distribution offline. On the other hand, the RSE updates PE distribution, which becomes recursive calculation. Specifically, the change points of PE are replaced by the long PE distribution and the short PE distribution. Then, the entropy of the long- time distribution and the entropy of the short- time distribution are calculated by the same calculation as the SE, and the sum of these difference values and the logarithm of the ratio of each PE is defined as the entropy value of the RSE. It has been reported that the evaluation of mental workload when subtasks were performed in the RSE is appropriate. However, there is a cautionary note that RSE is affected by disturbances such as the driving attitude of the driver, steering grasping position, road surface condition, and so on."

This is because the resonance frequency of roll, yaw, and pitch of the large bus is remarkably low, and the moving quantity of yaw and pitch increases or visibility is hindered by the sitting position due to the large car body. Especially, it becomes easy to get sick, since the front view cannot be seen, when it rides in the rear, and the prediction of the movement is not possible. Even in a large bus, it is less tiring to see the front view so that the vehicle motion can be predicted. There is no difference in the hangover easiness between upper floor and lower floor of the double- decker bus, because the effect of the vertical oscillation on the hangover is little. In general, the more going to the back seat, the more getting sick, and the more getting sick on the aisle side than on the window side. Women are more likely than men to get sick, and women are more likely than men to get sick when the scenery is not visible. To avoid getting sick on a large bus, we should sit in the front seat where we can see the view well. In the three- row seat minivan of the passenger car, there is no difference on whether it is easy to get sick as it becomes the rear seat. It is good as long as we can see the scenery, so it is not effective to prevent motion sickness even if we show the scenery from the side. Even a little is good, so it is important to be able to see the scenery ahead."

However, this is effective only when the semicircular canal is stimulated by rotational oscillation. In other words, vision strongly affects vestibular sensation."

However, the primary warning was not commercially successful because many extra warnings were called \"nuisance alarm.\" Therefore, many automated brakes do not have a primary warning. In addition, while some FVCWSs display vehicle- to- vehicle distance from the viewpoint of providing information, the information providing the element of the automated brake is only the secondary warning. Moreover, the timing of the automated brake application is later than the secondary warning, and the method of applying the brake is also an intense sudden brake, which a general driver would not apply for a lifetime."

In this section, validity is defined as the certainty that the evaluation can find out the true characteristics that suit the purpose of the evaluation. On the other hand, reliability is defined as the certainty of how accurately the evaluation result is obtained and is independent of whether it is the true characteristic to be evaluated. The following will focus on validity of evaluation using the DS. When trying to secure validity of evaluation using DS, it is necessary to inspect whether the evaluation purpose can be achieved by using DS. The motivation that an evaluator tries to use DS is because an experiment is difficult in the actual environment owing to some reasons. Namely, an evaluator asks a DS for the experimental reproduction equal with environment. However, even if its evaluation has validity in actual environment, the evaluation which is reproduced by DS is not necessarily to have validity. This is because the current level of DS technology is limited and can only reproduce the actual environment partially and basically. Due to the nature of the evaluation, the validity of evaluation using DS cannot be established without equivalence to the actual environment. Therefore, when it tries to prove the validity of evaluation using DS, it's equivalence must be checked by comparing the evaluation results in the actual environment with the evaluation results in DS. Otherwise, if it is possible, it is better just to conduct evaluation in the actual environment and there is no meaning to use DS. Moreover, it is difficult to conduct this comparison in the evaluation which assumes a dangerous situation such as the situation occurring in a traffic accident. There is some research on adjusting DS by the data acquired by the above comparison in a specific situation [13- 16]. However, even if this adjustment is conducted perfectly, strictly speaking, there is no guarantee of getting evaluation results equal to them in the actual environment except in situations where this comparison proves equivalence. It should be thought that the current DS technology has only limited reproducibility and it would be impossible to prove the validity of"

If DS can provide the information equal to the information which is provided by the actual environment for the driver and its evaluation has validity in the actual environment, it is thought that evaluation using DS would also be able to have validity. In this case, the most important point is \"the actual environment for the driver,\" not the actual environment. As mentioned above, the current DS technology cannot provide the information equal to information that is provided from the actual environment perfectly. However, if the limit of information that a DS can provide exceeds the amount of information that the human perceives from the actual information, in other words, the amount of information that the human can use to recognize the actual environment, the DS is equivalent to reproducing the actual environment for the driver. It is thought that a human cannot use all the abundant information that is provided from the actual environment. For instance, a human only receives necessary visual information from among those that are provided from the actual environment and this bottom- up information is complemented by a high- order brain function that performs as top- down processing (binocular stereoscopic processing, shadow stereoscopic processing, etc.). Then humans regenerate visual space in the brain by this process. It may not be necessary that DS can provide all of the visual information that is provided from the actual environment."

Photoreceptors are classified into cone cells and rod cells. There are about 7 million cone cells and 120 million rod cells in the retina. On the other hand, there are only about 1 million optic nerves that transmit nervous signals to a brain. Namely, nervous signals which are output from the photoreceptors are not transmitted to the brain directly. They are reconstructed by corporate processing of cells in the retina and transmit to the brain.

Vection is the moving sensation that occurs by only providing visual information which is got when humans move without providing physical moving information. For instance, when you get on the train while seeing a train that stops at the next platform through the window and then this train begins to move, you may have felt yourself moving in spite of your train not moving [27]. This sensation is vection. Vection would be considered a sense of compensating for vestibular sensation. Namely, vection is one of the strongest supporting sense systems for DS that is difficult to provide the information of vestibular sensation. Presently, it is thought that the visual information with the wide- angle provides a high sense of presence. This is based on the study that circular vection tends to occur because of visual information with a wide- angle [28]. On the other hand, it has been confirmed that linear vection occurs by only providing the extending visual information to the central vision area [29]. Namely, When the DS is used in a scenario where the vehicle is driving on a highway, it may be not necessary that DS provide the visual information with wide- angle in order to get the high presence equal to the actual environment, unlike when the DS is used in a scenario where the vehicle turns an intersection on a city area. Moreover, It is important for the DS visual information to make the driver recognize the positional relationship between the vehicle position and stationary objects (walls, ground, mountains, etc.) correctly. Whether or not the driver feels this positional relationship correctly determines the occurrence of vection on"

Therefore, it is important to suppress the jitter of Computer Graphics (hereinafter called \"CG\") because there is a possibility that the jitter of CG disturb to recognize that the stationary objects is to stay stably and firmly. It is considered that the driver's sense of speed depends on the perceived relative speed with the surrounding objects. Especially for the driver, it is important in driving to perceive the absolute speed of the vehicle. Then, the visual information that becomes the information source is the optical flow generated by the stationary object. In other words, it is important for the driver to feel that the optical flow is firmly caused by a stationary object. The shaking of the image caused by this jitter of CG may prevent the driver from feeling the object expressed as a stationary object in CG. In case of setting big stationary objects in a distance, it may be important to express a decrease of contrast due to the absorption of light by air for these stationary objects by CG. The optical flow, which is the visual source of information that gives the driver a sense of speed, changes with distance. It is also important for the driver to correctly recognize the sense of distance from the stationary object in order for the driver to perceive the absolute speed. The decrease in contrast due to the absorption of light increases as the distance increases. This visual information may lead to the driver feeling the correct distance between an own vehicle and stationary objects based on the driver's experience, and as a result, the driver would feel the correct absolute speed."

Namely, these semicircular canals react to the acceleration generated by the rotation in the direction in which they are placed. An otolith container consists of the utriculus and the sacculus. It has been pointed out that humans perceive acceleration from these vestibular organs, while humans may also perceive angular velocity by integrating these acceleration information into the brain [30].

One of the purposes of the sense organ of vestibule information is to catch the change point of one's own movement and sense the degree of one's own movement. Therefore, when the vehicle is traveling at a constant speed, it is basically impossible to perceive whether the own state is stopped or moving. In that sense, vection performs the important function of compensating the sensation of one's own movement. Examples of devices that stimulate the vestibular sensation in DS include six- axis motion devices, translation devices, and turntables. The purpose of these devices is to properly provide the driver with the acceleration that occurs in the driver while driving. However, it is impossible to achieve this in all situations. Therefore, it is important to smoothly induce vection while the acceleration information provided by these devices is provided. The top- down processing in the brain links vestibular sensation information with vection."

If there are differences in the reproducibility between the perceptual information provided by DS, it is necessary to pay attention to the scenario provided by DS. For instance, when DS is used to realize a scenario in which a vehicle turns left or right at an orthogonal intersection, it is relatively easy to provide the necessary visual information. On the other hand, it is very difficult to provide vestibular sensation information suitable for this scenario on the DS. If the DS cannot completely provide vestibular sensation information that is consistent with the visual information, it is basically better to give up on realizing this scenario with this DS. If this scenario is reproduced by this DS, the lack of vestibular information for the visual information occurs. This lack does not simply mean that the driver is not provided with the vestibular information. This lack provides information that there is no vestibular sense information that should be provided originally and exposes the driver to the situation where physical contradictions occur between visual information and vestibular information. It is thought that our perceptual information processing is basically applied for the situation with physically consistent perceptual information. Therefore, in the above case, the relation between the perceptual information is physically broken, and it is considered that it is difficult for a person to perform perceptual information processing. It becomes difficult for the driver to build spatial perception, and there is a concern that DS sickness may occur. In that sense, it means that the DS cannot provide the driver with the perceptual information equal with the actual environment at the"

When the level is changed, there are three kinds of items that have an effect: vehicle control, peripheral monitoring, and response in case of system troubles. In Level 1, vehicle control is performed by automated driving and driver in cooperation, in Level 2, vehicle control is performed by automated driving, in Level 3, peripheral monitoring is added, and in Level 4, response in case of system troubles is added. Although the functions of Levels 4 and 5 are the same, Level 5 does not require a driver, so that driving operational devices such as a steering wheel and pedals are not required."

In addition, in a situation where operation control is not required, there is a concern that the operator may not be able to concentrate on monitoring the surroundings even if the driver is obliged to monitor the surroundings. As a matter of course, if the driver himself/herself is driving, he/she cannot drive without monitoring the surroundings, so the driver concentrates on monitoring the surroundings. We all know that if you are doing some kind of task, such as using a cell phone to focus your attention on a conversation, you cannot focus on monitoring your surroundings and drive safely.

However, it is more important to estimate the process by which the results are obtained and compare them with the actual results than to obtain the experimental results. When the take- over request is issued, if the driver is not looking ahead, it is likely that the driver will immediately turn his/her face forward and turn his/her attention forward. The driver will try to understand the situation to find out why the take- over request was issued. Then, once the driver understands the situation, he/she should choose the action appropriate for the situation and move on to the action such as steering or braking. When such an action is carried out, the take- over of the driving task is completed, and the vehicle enters the so- called manual driving loop in the driving feedback loop as shown in Figure 5.14. In the case of automated driving, the driver is not involved in the operation at all, so it can be said that the vehicle is outside the driving which is out of the feedback loop. That is, after the take- over request, the driver can be thought of as returning to the manual driving operation, understanding the situation, and starting the manual driving operation to complete the driving feedback loop by manual operation. If the above actions were completed within TTC seconds, the take- over would have been established."

Next, as in the previous experiment, we conducted a test on a DS to see whether the take- over was possible in mixed traffic. The TTC is 7 s, and the overtaking vehicle approaches from diagonally behind after the take- over request is presented. The timing of the appearance of the passing vehicle, whether or not it is moving, is changed for each experiment to prevent the driver from learning the experiment scenario. The number of collaborators in the experiment was 14, the same as in the previous experiment. Of the 14 participants, 13 successfully took over under various tasks even in the mixed traffic environments. However, there was a case in which a driver caused a contact accident only once in several experiments. It was an accident in which a passing vehicle diagonally behind was found late, an avoidance operation was impossible, and a deceleration was insufficient, and the vehicle came into contact with an obstacle. It is sufficient to show that there are cases in which the take- over did not succeed, although a total of 100 experiments have only 1 occurrence. In other words, the take- over cannot always be established even when there is a margin of 7 seconds in TTC."

It can be seen that this problem has a problem on the driver side and a problem on the vehicle side. The problem on the driver side is whether or not the driver is in a state in which take- over is immediately possible when the take- over request is issued. The problem on the vehicle side is that take- over cannot be supported. Whether or not the driver can take- over is whether or not a forward monitoring can be performed immediately upon the take- over request, the situation can be recognized, and the smooth transition to operation can be made. That is, the driver has sufficient alertness. Therefore, the necessity of the driver monitor is discussed in order to determine the arousal level of the driver at the time of the take- over request or before the request. Should the driver monitor be installed, the driver be constantly monitored during automated driving, and if a decrease in alertness is detected, the warning or stimulus should be given to restore alertness? It would be nice if the driver monitor could accurately monitor the driver's wakefulness, but what if the warning is issued when the wakefulness is not lowered by mistake? It is not a serious mistake, but if the driver is enjoying a comfortable automated driving experience, he/she might find the warning offensive."

Active conversation and singing do not reduce alertness, but it does burden drivers. Section 6.2.1 describes specific experimental results. The tasks we tested in our lab that did not reduce alertness included gripping the steering wheel, providing information based on where the driver is driving, flashing LEDs based on breathing rate during high alertness, and flashing LEDs that trigger saccade stimulation. Of these, steering wheel gripping and saccade induction were particularly effective. If the driver holds the steering wheel, he/she will not be able to lower his/her alertness from his/her driving habits. Saccade induction seems to be effective due to the biological characteristics of humans, but there is a problem whether it can be performed voluntarily."

Switching from automated to manual driving operation cannot be done easily by determining specifications. Conversely, what about switching from manual driving operation to automated driving? The author has experienced this in the driving support system, and so there is no problem. With ACC, the driver simply turns on the set switch and he/she can safely leave the pedal. The same goes for switching to automated driving, where the driver can turn it on at any time. If you are worried that automated driving might require a special HMI, try it out on a DS, as we did in the take- over experiments. In driving support systems and automated driving, the driver entrusts the driving operation to the automobile, which greatly increases the utilization of the DS. When the driver drives the vehicle manually, the behavior of the vehicle in response to steering wheel operation and the feeling that the behavior of the vehicle imparts to the driver through the steering wheel are strictly required. However, in the case of ADAS, the driver does not have a severe sense of feeling required to drive the vehicle through the steering wheel, and therefore, if the DS pays attention to the graphics representing the driving environment, the generation of G may not be as accurate as during manual driving. Therefore, even low- cost DS can be fully utilized."

That is, in a situation where the brake of the automated driving vehicle is broken and cannot stop suddenly, there is one pedestrian (a gentleman looks rich) in the driving lane and two pedestrians (young students) in the other lane as shown in Figure 5.19. Automated driving vehicles will either turn to the roadside to avoid contact with pedestrian groups and collide with the roadside zone, or they will keep driving and crash into the pedestrian. In this ultimate situation, automated driving can be programmed to choose. This is not a matter of developer preference. What should we base our decision on, not my taste?"

Among these parameters, a common trend among respondents, regardless of nationality, age, or religion, is to prefer humans to animals, large numbers to small numbers, and young people to the elderly. It also tends to give priority to compliance with social status and traffic rules. However, there is no consistent trend for other parameters. However, there are regional trends. For example, in Finland, where the income gap is small, passengers or pedestrians, or social status is not a determining factor. In Central and South America, however, many felt that homeless people and criminals do not have to be helped. Japan's trend is slightly different from that of the rest of the world. That is, they do not value the number of lives saved. In other words, they tend to focus on who to help rather than the number. They also tend not to change their course."

For example, suppose an automobile lane is one lane away from each other, and there is an area with a bicycle lane next to the automobile lane. In order to avoid the risk of contact with oncoming vehicles, the vehicle is programmed to travel a little further from the oncoming lane and a little closer to the bike lane. This reduces the risk of oncoming vehicle contact but increases the risk of bicycle contact. That means there will be a statistically significant increase in crashes between automated driving vehicles and bicycles in the region. In this way, changing the specification of automated driving will change the type of accident. For this reason, the author thinks it would be better to standardize the specifications of automated driving, which is related to accidents."

Drivers should have a clear sense of ethics, and the automated driving ethic should be the same. The simple one is to set the rule of which to choose as the production rule and select logically by if- then- else. Changing the production rules of the database by destination would allow for a variety of specifications. However, this approach requires that all confronting situations be embedded in the database. The actual situation may be ambiguous or unexpected. As a result, automated driving decisions are quickly broken in situations that if- then- else cannot determine. In order to deal with situations that do not fit in the database or are unexpected, automated driving vehicles will need to learn about"

Let us see how the automated driving vehicle that follows the three principles of robotics behaves in the trolley problem. When the driver is not in the vehicle, the driver should change the lane in accordance with Article 1 and cause a self- injury accident in the situation where the driver is a pedestrian in the straight line and the driver is the obstacle in the lane change. If there were five people going straight and one person changing lanes, they would try to change lanes to minimize the number of victims. However, it turns out that the three robot principles alone are not enough because they are against Article 1. What would it do if it had a driver and one person going straight and the obstacle changing lanes? Going straight is against Article 1, and changing lanes is also against Article 1 because it harms the driver. Even if the driver instructs the driver to go straight ahead, it is against Article 1, but even if the driver changes lanes, it is against Article 1 and cannot make a decision. Again, the three principles of robotics are not enough. New rules are needed to ensure that decisions are made in accordance with ethical standards."

This value is necessary not only for engineers but also for policymakers and should benefit everyone, not for the benefit of a group or a single country.  \n2. Political decision and data handling: When properly designed and implemented, A/IS has great potential to foster culturally appropriate political freedom and democracy. These systems improve political efficiency, but digital data should be protected in a verifiable manner.  \n3. Technical dependency: A/IS should provide reliable services, and trust means that A/IS can enhance human-driven value and securely and actively achieve its designed objectives. The technology should monitor that its operation is consistent with human values and meets the prescribed ethical objectives of respecting rights. In addition, the verification and verification process should be developed to be auditable and authoritative."

Of course, there is also the idea that a Level 5 automated driving vehicle will inherit the values it learned when it was developed. However, ethics can vary slightly depending on the user and the area in which they use it, so it is better to have a mechanism that allows them to always learn. Therefore, the DS is utilized."

How do you communicate with other drivers during normal driving? You can think of the blinker when you turn right and left at the intersection or change lanes, the passing when you want to pass, the thank you hazard, the horn, etc. These are also implemented in automated driving vehicles, and there are no particular problems. However, communication without using the vehicle's blinker, hazard, passing, or horn becomes a problem. That is, how the automated driving vehicle can show what the driver has shown to other traffic with gestures and facial expressions. Level 5 automated driving vehicles do not have drivers. Perhaps all the windows in the automated driving vehicle are smoked so you cannot see inside. Under these circumstances, if the automated driving vehicle starts to slow in front of a pedestrian who wants to cross the road, the pedestrian might not know whether the vehicle wants to tell the pedestrian to cross or just slow down for some reason."

It was useful as a primitive form of a vehicle- pedestrian communication tool. However, it was abolished in 1999 because it would become an import barrier. The speed indicator was unique to Japan. It was a victim of the automobile export war. Even imported trucks could be approved if they were modified and equipped with speed indicator lamps, but they were regarded as import barriers because of the cost of modification. In addition, some pedestrians who did not have a driver's license did not even know the meaning or existence of the speed indicator lights, and the fact that it did not function well was a remote cause of the abolition."

At the very least, you will need something to show that it is the automated driving vehicle so it can be recognized correctly by other traffic. As a means of communication with pedestrians and other vehicles other than blinker and passing, it is possible to attach an electric bulletin board facing outside the vehicle. On- board electronic bulletin boards are often used by public vehicles for traffic regulations and construction guidance. Electric bulletin boards are sold not only in public vehicles but also in stores, where messages such as \"Thank you\" and \"After you\" are displayed or printed in flowing characters. However, under the current Road Traffic Law, it is necessary to be careful when lighting other than the lights, and strictly speaking, lighting while driving may violate the law in some countries. In the inexpensive one, LEDs can be arranged in a matrix, dot characters can be selected to store several patterns, and messages can be displayed depending on the situation. Adding speed indicator light to this and providing the message for every situation could be the tool for communicating with the outside of the automated driving vehicle. However, it takes longer to read the message than it does to turn on the blinker or pass the ball, and it can not be identified from a distance. Therefore, it is necessary to have a means of communication that can be understood instantly."

It is a phrase that expresses the state of realizing an interior in which the front seat can rotate backward and face the rear seat because there is no need to drive. In order to communicate with pedestrians, F015 installed LED matrix display units on the front and back of the vehicle to display messages. When there is a pedestrian, a zebra zone showing the pedestrian crossing is drawn on the road by a visible light laser, and the pedestrian can be urged to walk. When the pedestrian swings his/her hand, he/she understands the gesture, draws a text, and communicates with the pedestrian.

It was important to know the awakening state of the driver, and if the driving tasks are mixed between the driver and the system in the future, the system needs to know the driver's state, and one method is to use brain waves. In the research, it is possible to measure by using the introduced EEG, but when using it as a driver during actual driving, a more compact and simplified measurement system is required."

The driver condition was estimated by measuring the vehicle motion because the driving performance appeared at the distance between vehicles and the driving position in the lane. Further, in estimating the driver state from the operation system, it is easier to use the steering operation which causes the lateral movement of the vehicle than the operation of the pedal which causes the longitudinal movement of the vehicle. Therefore, in Section 5.8, the SE method was introduced"

The DS has technical limitations at this time, on the other hand, drivers do not use all the information provided by the actual environment. Namely, the DS does not have to provide the driver with all the information provided from the actual environment, and the information that the DS can provide only needs to include the information used by the driver. Even if there is a limit to the information that the DS can provide, this can be done by optimizing the provided information or limiting the usage scenarios based on the mechanism of perception of the information used by the driver. If the information used by the driver can be covered by the information that can be provided from this limited DS, it means that it may be possible to design a DS that can obtain exceptionally reliable experimental results. In order to achieve this, the designer of DS would be required to have knowledge of the perceptual information used by the driver when driving, the mechanism of this perception, knowledge of the technical limits of the DS, and the creativity that can effectively connect these knowledge."

The advanced support systems often use meters, mirrors, and the information display to inform drivers the operating status and to alert them the emergency. Most of the systems that are actually on the market inform drivers the possibilities of collisions by the combination of warning displays and warning sounds when the systems are activated. However, as the number of types of systems grows, the amount of information increase, which cause difficulty for the drivers to immediately recognize what danger the warning is for. In the future, the amount of the information provided will be expected to be increasing much more by utilizing the technology of C- ITS that is a communication technology with other traffic participants, such as vehicle- to- vehicle and vehicle- to- pedestrian communication [1], which is considered by companies and governments. When the drivers receive many information in dangerous situations, they may panic or drive in the wrong operation. When the display position is not appropriate, the information cannot be properly transmitted to the drivers, and the systems may not be effective enough to avoid collisions. In order to reduce these risks, it is necessary to study how to provide the information so that drivers can easily recognize and intuitively decide how they should perform the driving operation."

In this study, we newly constructed three patterns in the system: Base, Distance, and Sound. In Base, the types and directions of approaching objects were shown on the HUD. In Distance, the background colors were gradually changed to green, yellow, and red, according to the distance between the ego vehicle and the approaching object, the types, and directions. In Sound, the warning sounds were presented with the playing cycle changed according to the distance. We compared the three patterns of Base, Distance, and Sound with an existing system, Off that displayed only the speed of the ego vehicle on the HUD. Table 6.1 shows the examples of the information provided in the four systems of Base, Distance, Sound, and Off, when a vehicle suddenly appeared from the left side."

Using the obtained data, the ratio of gaze time during driving was calculated by nine divided areas in the front area of the vehicle (as shown in Figure 6.3): front window, left- front window, room mirror, HUD, meter, left- door mirror, left- side window, right- door mirror, and right- side window. After each experiment, we conducted a questionnaire using a five- step selection"

As a result, it was confirmed that the system using sounds had the most effect on the brake operation, and the system using display also had a certain effect. On the other hand, the system that presented sounds resulted in an increase in the evaluation of annoyance and could be unsuitable as a means to always use for providing the information. This study simply changed the type of information presentation in each system to compare the effect. However, in the future, it will be necessary to examine the method of providing the information of traffic participants in blind spots in a more complex way.

The activation timing of alarms is set in order not to interfere with the drivers' normal operations. When the alarm interferes with the driver's driving operation, there is a possibility that the functions of the AEBS are not fully utilized by providing unsolicited feeling to the driver. However, there are various timings of drivers' operation in normal driving. By presenting an alert early for some drivers, it may be possible to take actions with sufficient margin to avoid collisions without interfering with the drivers' operations. Therefore, this study examined the effect and effectiveness, using the driver model reflecting the individual driving characteristics for the activation timing of the AEBS alarm. (Figure 6.4) As driver models, transfer function models, crossover models, forward gaze models, fuzzy models, and neural network (NN) models have been proposed. There are also tailor- made driving support systems [2] that reflect the individual characteristics of drivers, using the driver model. In this research, we used a NN, which measures the nonlinear driving operation of a driver and could model nonlinear control to model it. The driver model is constructed by training NN to learn driving operations of a driver. The driver model monitors the driver's operation by estimating the driving operation of the driver. When the driver's operation is different from the normal driving, such as a delay in brake operation, the driver model makes the decision to present an alert. In this study, we examined the effect by applying the driver model to the alarm activation timing."

The scenario in the experiment assumed a rear- end collision on an expressway and targeted on the braking operation that the driver performed against the braking of the preceding vehicle ahead during driving. Table 6.4 shows the traveling speed and the deceleration of the preceding vehicle as the experimental parameters. NN was trained using the measured braking data to construct a driver model, where the braking operation start timing was calculated from the TTC. The NN was a hierarchical structure type with eight inputs and two outputs. The back- propagation method was used for learning and the number of learning was 100 times. The time required for learning was about "

We reproduced the situation in which the ego vehicle collided with the preceding vehicle due to the inattentive driving on the expressway. The experiment was performed assuming the scene where the alarm was activated in the reproduced situation. In the experiment, the participants were instructed to gaze at the navigation screen, where the inattentive states were simulated, to recognize the scene ahead by presenting the warning, and to perform the driving operation in order to avoid the collision. The participants performed a five- stage evaluation of the operation timing and safety in each experiment, as shown in Figure 6.6. The experimental conditions also included the provisions of the technical guideline for the front obstacle collision mitigation braking systems for passenger cars, which uniformly defined the operation timing. Under the experimental conditions, the effectiveness of the alarm activation timing in the NN that reflected individual driving characteristics was examined. The alarm activation timing in the experiment was set to TTC for "

In this system, the model was constructed based on the driver's brake operation, and then the alarm activation timing was determined. Generally, when the deceleration of the preceding vehicle is large, the risk in driving is high. Therefore, the driver might accept the alarm even if it was presented earlier than the timing of his/her braking operation. For some drivers, the deceleration of the preceding vehicle was small. When the traveling speed was low, some participants evaluated that the activation timing was early. In this case, the drivers might accept the alarm when the timing was a little later than their usual braking operations."

From the result, it was found that the high safety evaluation was obtained when the alarm reflecting individual operating characteristics in the alarm activation timing was presented earlier than the uniformly set operation timing. This tendency was also seen in the evaluation of the alarm timing shown in Figure 6.10. Providing an early warning can contribute to avoid a collision accident by the driver's operation because the time margin until the collision increases."

In the learning drive, the guidance sound was issued, and the course without dangerous scene was used in the same course as the familiar drive.

When we asked Group B why the sound was heard, most of them thought it was an approach warning by pedestrians or other vehicles. Therefore, there were many people who imagined the warning type without explaining beforehand, and the driver was conscious of the guidance sound."

However, since these methods cannot improve the environment in which the arousal state lowers, they may cause the drowsiness again after the stimulation presentation. On the other hand, the methods which always give the stimulation regardless of the arousal state of the driver can very easily realize the arousal state maintenance of the driver, if these can be dealt with problems such as troublesome and habituation to the stimulation. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the method to maintain the arousal condition while giving constant stimulation."

Then, the experiment was carried out for 16 general drivers by the driving simulator (SloTDS- O in 2.1), which reproduced these five kinds of tasks, and the wakefulness maintenance effect was compared."

The main purpose of this task is to prevent the driver in the automated driving from engaging in the task other than the driving operation and to quickly return to the driving operation in the emergency. Since no special equipment or special operation is required, the driver can be easily engaged. However, it is concerned that it leads to the physical fatigue, because both arms are restrained, even if the driver does not actually drive. In this study, the driver is required to actively steer the steering wheel like the manual operation according to the driving of the vehicle under the condition that the driver understands the automated driving."

In devising this technique, the physiological phenomenon of the human was referred. It is generally known that the human respiratory cycle changes by various factors, and it is reported that the respiratory frequency decreases when sleepiness occurs [13] and that the respiration synchronizes with rhythmic movement of limbs and visual stimulation. From these facts, it was considered that the lowering of the respiratory frequency was avoided by presenting the blinking stimulation in the usual respiratory cycle for the visual sense of the driver, by synchronizing the actual respiratory cycle with the blinking stimulation, and as a result, it was connected with the maintenance of the arousal condition."

In this study, the subjects were classified into six attributes (\"young, middle- aged, and elderly\" in \"male/female\") shown in Table 6.13 to obtain driver data for different ages, and each subject was recruited. The experiment was conducted between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. due to the arrangement of subjects. Since the driving behavior is expected to be carried out in various scenes of daily life, the effect of the meal on the experiment day on the drowsiness was expected, though large restriction was not set in the experiment, and the intake of the caffeine was limited in addition to hearing about the meal before the experiment. Four of the 16 subjects were excluded from the analysis because the conditions differed from those of the other subjects due to insufficient experimental equipment or errors in teaching to the collaborators during the experiment.

The DS has a moving function in the longitudinal and lateral directions, and can transmit the inclination of the road surface and the acceleration change of the vehicle. Since the steering wheel does not have the function to rotate automatically, it was installed in the condition that only reaction force to the center is generated. The driving course is a circuit of 14- km circumference, which was made as a model of the urban center ring line outer circumference of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway, and tunnels, junctions, and traffic flow were also reproduced."

As the reason, it seems to be related that the body was moved during the automated driving and that the posture was taken in the same way as the manual driving. It is said that the effect of the active action on the arousal is large, and it is effective for the finger difference call of the railway operator in the familiar thing. And, the conversation is also noticed as an active action, and the arousal effect by the conversation during driving and monotonous work are studied. The present experimental results show that the active task has a higher arousal maintenance effect than the passive task. Since the inside of a vehicle is narrow and the same posture is often observed for a long time, it is considered that the active load of holding the steering wheel and actually rotating the steering wheel effectively led to the arousal maintenance. And, there was \"I woke up just by holding the steering wheel\" as a comment of the subject person after the experiment. From this, it was indicated that the degree of concentration to the driving naturally heightens by becoming the same posture as usual driving, even if it is recognized to be the automated driving in the brain."

As the factor in which the falling sleep tendency which is different by the age group appeared, we consider sleep disorder and functional depression of the sense organ with the aging. In general, it is known that human sleep changes with age. In particular, it has been reported that the elderly have decreased total sleep time, increased shallow sleep, and decreased sleep efficiency due to arousal from sleep [14]. In this experiment, the existence of these symptoms is uncertain, because the life rhythm of the subject is not accurately grasped. However, when these symptoms occur chronically to the driver, even if the person intends to take the sleep time of the previous day sufficiently, the sleep is not actually sufficient, and the sleepiness may easily appear in the daytime. In addition, the tendency of early to bed and early to rise by the progress of the sleep phase is easy to appear in the old people, and this seems to become a factor of the sleepiness generation in the daytime. Aging is also known to affect sensory organs such as vision and hearing, and symptoms such as visual field narrowing, hearing loss, and reduction of the audible range appear. As a result, there was a possibility that the elderly driver could not see the arousal maintenance stimulation, could not hear the driving sound from the simulator, and could not feel the arousal maintenance stimulation in comparison with the young and middle- aged driver. From the above fact, it seems to be important to consider not all drivers uniformly, but age group and characteristic of the user deeply when dealing with the awakening of the driver. All the contents described here are hypotheses. The number of data used for the analysis is also 3- 5 persons for each age group, and it is insufficient for completely grasping the characteristics of the age group. In order to clarify the relationship between the age group and falling asleep, it is necessary to increase the number of experimental subjects in each age group and to conduct large- scale experiments focusing on the daily life rhythm of drivers."

And, as new methods, two kinds of tasks of presenting information on vehicle periphery and using optical stimulation were proposed. On six kinds of environments including these five kinds of tasks and the condition of doing nothing, the experiments using the automated driving function of the DS were carried out for general drivers of 16 persons, and the arousal maintenance effect was compared. As the result, though 10 persons in 12 persons fell asleep under the condition of doing nothing, it became possible to reduce the number of persons by carrying out each task. This effect was found in active tasks. And, it became clear that the holding steering wheel has the fixed arousal action, that the consideration of the habituation to not only the content but also the voice itself is necessary for the voice stimulation, that the light stimulation can carry out the arousal support in the range which the driver does not notice, etc. In addition, the possibility in which the age group of the driver was greatly related to the awakening of the driver was indicated. On this fact, we indicated the possibility of the effect by sleep disorder and functional depression of the sense organ by the aging."

In addition, since the sleepiness of the driver is expected to be greatly affected by the sleep of the previous day, the meal immediately before and the time zone, etc., the control of the experimental condition and the change of the driver characteristic by the change of the condition, etc. would also be examined.

The LF/HF fluctuates unsteadily (Figure 6.35), and it seems to be difficult to judge the reaction. RMSSD reacts more rapidly and stabilizes faster than RRI (Figure 6.36). CVRR/RMSSD is similar to CVRR, and the reaction time is a little slower than RRI, and it is shown that it fluctuates smoothly without rapid fluctuation, and that it is stabilized afterwards (Figure 6.37). Finally, the LP origin distance was the same reaction time as RRI (Figure 6.38). Therefore, it was found that the reaction time for take- over was faster in the order of RMSSD, RRI/LP, CVRR/RMSSD/CVRR, and LF/HF."

And, RMSSD, CVRR/RMSSD, and LP were introduced in addition to the index of the conventional technique in order to verify the reaction time, and the comparison was carried out. As the result, it was proven that RMSSD, RRI, LP, CVRR/RMSSD, CVRR, and LF/HF responded quickly in this order. From this result, it was proven that the accuracy hardly changed on the classification using RRI, CVRR/RMSSD, and RMSSD, comparing the classification result of machine learning by the combination of the conventional index with the combination of the newly introduced index. Therefore, in view of both reaction time and classification accuracy, the classification using the above new index seems to be more suitable for the arousal degree judgment. In the future, we will judge the arousal degree by the above index."

Organizations in each country, such as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and SAE International, have defined the roadmaps of fully automated driving systems, in which drivers are not involved in driving at all. The roadmaps include a system that stops the automatic driving function when the automatic driving system reaches the functional limit and shifts to the manual driving. In this system, there is a possibility that drivers cannot perform appropriate driving, when the drivers have been in low awakening states, such as drowsiness, at the timing of switching the system from automatic driving to manual driving."

After the automatic driving system was canceled, the driver had to control driving. Since there was the difference of a speed between the interrupting vehicle and the ego vehicle, the driver needed to perform a driving operation to avoid a collision. In this experiment, we examined the drivers' behavior for avoiding collision at that moment and compared the avoidance behaviors of the drivers in between low arousal states and arousal states. When the system switched from automatic driving to manual driving, alarm sounds were presented to notify the drivers of switching the system. Figure 6.42 shows a schematic diagram of the situation in the experiment."

This evaluation method used the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) evaluation method that was defined in the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry project. In the evaluation method, the five- level evaluation was judged from the facial expressions of participants and self- evaluation, as shown in Table 6.16, which shows the levels of decreasing alertness used in the evaluation. Levels 1, 3, and 4 in Table 6.16 were used in this study. Level 1 was defined to be arousal states, while levels 3 and 4 were defined to be low- arousal states. Levels 2 and 5 were excluded because level 5 indicated sleep states in which the driver could perform a driving operation due to the closed eyes, and level 2 was classified as arousal states rather than a low- arousal states."

When the system switched from automatic driving to manual driving, the lower the arousal level was, the longer the reaction time of the drivers became, as shown in Figure 6.43. For the 20 participants, the average response time was 2.03 s in level 1 indicating low- arousal states, 3.61 s in level 3, and 4.33 s in level 4. These results show that the reaction time required about 1.58 s delay in level 3 and about 2.30 s delay in level 4 compared to the awake states, when the system was switched from the automatic driving to the manual driving."

Autonomous driving systems are the systems to support the driver's safety and comfort. However, when the system's functional limit requires the switching to manual driving, the delay time for driver's operations shown in this study should be fully considered. For example, the provision of information and reminder in advance might be effective for the delay time. In addition, drivers who are in arousal states can perform the driving operation quickly and properly. Therefore, it might be effective to use two types of systems together: one system to detect the driver's wakefulness during autonomous driving and the other system to prevent drivers in low- arousal states from performing driving operations."

This can exhibit effects in providing driving support to the elderly as a result. Long- distance driving also becomes easier. Work such as daily commuting going back and forth on the same road also can be systematized. Therefore, wide- ranging use from long- distance leisure activities to daily commutes can be expected from the widespread use of self- driving automobiles [18]."

This automated driving system is classified as Level 3 automated driving in the NHTSA and SAE roadmaps in Table 6.17 [24]. It is thought that drivers in this automated driving system could perform the driving operation at the time of switching if the driver can carefully monitor the control of the system. However, there is the possibility that the driver cannot appropriately operate the vehicle when switching from automated to manual driving if the driver is in a low awakening state (e.g., drowsy) [25]."

In this regard, experiments were conducted in the same conditions on drivers in a low awakening state and normal state as a verification method of whether driving behavior is accurate, and we investigate and verify this by comparing each driving behavior."

However, if the driver falls asleep during automated driving on the expressway, then there is the possibility that a smooth transition to manual driving may not occur near the expressway exit. Therefore, another research objective is to clarify driver operation characteristics when the driver falls asleep during automated driving, the automated driving is canceled at the expressway exit, and the driver transitions from a low awakening state to an alert state."

A record of such electrical phenomena in the brain is referred to as an EEG. Each part human cerebrum is related to perceptual information processing and body movement control, and it is said that inferences on the relationship between human behavior and brain function could be made by measuring the potential fluctuations derived from each of the parts of the cerebrum. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology determined 21 points in the head for deriving EEGs, and this derivation method is called the 10/20 electrode system (10/20 system) [26]. Actual measurements involve picking and choosing from these 21 points specified by the 10/20 system as a basis. Figure 6.47 shows a conceptual diagram of the 10/20 system and the derivation sites in the 10/20 system. This 10/20 system can be classified into the two methods of the reference derivation method and bipolar derivation method. The reference derivation method measures potential differences by attaching one electrode to an unrelated electrode such as an earlobe and another electrode to the scalp, and this has been used in clinical examinations. The bipolar derivation method records potential differences between two points on the scalp. The reference derivation method, which is often used in the field of ergonomics, was used in this study, and the three locations where "

The automated driving system placed from levels 1 through 3 in NHTSA and SAE in the automated driving system roadmap shows that this is automated driving, but this is mainly operated by the driver. Therefore, drivers must constantly monitor the automated driving system. However, drivers may have their attention diverted when traveling long distances or driving on familiar roads such as commutes, and the possibility of falling asleep or looking away increases. This indicates that there is a risk where drivers may temporarily not be able to conduct the monitoring in an automated driving system. Drivers may be able to immediately return to monitoring the system operation in the case of inattentive or temporarily careless driving, but there is the possibility that drivers cannot suitably operate the vehicle when switching from automated to manual driving in emergency conditions if the driver has fallen asleep or is in a low awakening state."

The operational characteristics of the driver relating to emergency avoidance were analyzed during these experimental conditions. Experiments under the same conditions were conducted for a driver in an alert state in order to compare with the operational characteristics of a driver in a low awakening state. The methods described in Section 6.8.3.1.3 were used in the evaluation of the driver awakening state. EEG measurements shown in Section 6.8.2.2 were also used.

For example, systems which sound an alarm when the driver is no longer holding the steering wheel have been considered in the NHTSA and SAE level 3 system, where the driver is the main operator. However, the purpose of using the automated driving system is to reduce the burdens of driving, and for that purpose. Therefore, the construction of an automated driving system without holding a steering wheel has been considered, and operating the automated driving system without holding the steering wheel by presenting the functional limit of the system as an alarm to the driver has also been considered. In this study, experiments were conducted in the low awakening state of the driver with the assumption of a state in which the steering wheel is not held, which has a high risk due to switching from automated driving to manual driving. Therefore, experiments were conducted by informing the participants to not hold the steering wheel during automated driving."

This study also set a large vehicle running on the left- hand lane of the autonomous vehicle in order to simulate actual traffic volumes. The driver was not informed prior to the experiment that an interrupting vehicle would appear from the merging lane while driving the automated driving system, and the number of tests was conducted once per driver. This was because once the driver experienced the fact that there was an interrupting vehicle, the driver would anticipate future occurrences and mentally prepare for this, changing their driving operation. Similarly, this was because it was assumed that the system switching to manual driving under situations which the driver did not predict would occur in environments where the automated driving system was actually used. There were 60 drivers participating in this experiment (40 in low awakening state and 20 in alert state), and experimental data conducted in the first session were used for analysis. A schematic of the experimental course is shown in Figure 6.48."

The automated driving system positioned at NHTSA and SAE levels 4 and 5 on the automated driving system roadmap has the system as the main operator. Therefore, the driver is not obligated to constantly monitor the automated driving system. However, there is the possibility that drivers may not be able to smoothly switch to manual driving near exits if the driver falls asleep during automated driving of expressways."

The driving operations when switching from automatic driving to manual driving were investigated under these conditions. Data analysis was conducted on the following five experimental results obtained from this experiment. At this time, the reaction time was defined as the time until the driver of the autonomous vehicle steps on the brake, where the moment the interrupting vehicle completed its interruption set as the start of the reaction time (zero point). A schematic of this definition is shown in Figure 6.59. Furthermore, the reason for why the reaction time, maximum brake pedal force, and time to maximum brake pedal force were used in the analysis was because the reaction time was for measuring how much time was needed until the driver operated the brake, and the maximum brake pedal force was to verify whether the driver could appropriately operate the brake. Furthermore, the time to maximum brake pedal force was to verify how much time a driver would need to exert a maximum pedal force after stepping on the brake (i.e., whether they could control the brake pedal force). The above elements are essential for safe brake operation."

It can be seen from Figure 6.56 that the time to maximum brake pedal force of the driver when switching from automated driving to manual driving became shorter as the alertness level increased. It can be seen from this that drivers in an alert state do not suddenly apply the brake and appropriately operate the brakes while adjusting. In contrast, it can be seen that a braking operation close to sudden braking is conducted among drivers at a high alertness level due to the short time to maximum brake pedal force. Therefore, these experimental results showed that low awakening state drivers did not have the tendency to conduct appropriate braking operations when compared to those at an alert state."

Most drivers conducted collision avoidance with only braking operations, so driving operations for collision avoidance using steering were observed in two participants for alertness level 1, three in alertness level 3, and three in alertness level 4. It can be seen from Figure 6.64 that the amount of corrective steering increased as the alertness level increased. Therefore, it is thought that the frequency of corrective steering increased in the low awakening state when compared to that in the alert state because the former could not prepare for steering operations, and the driver could not steer as intended."

The experimental scenario was a scene where a low- speed preceding vehicle interrupts from a merging lane in front of the autonomous vehicle, at which time the automated driving system switches from automated driving to manual driving, and the driver must operate the vehicle so as to avoid colliding with the preceding vehicle. The following conclusions were obtained from these results."

Results showed that the reaction time of drivers was distributed from 2.5 to 6 s at alertness level 4, 3.5- 5 s at level 3, and 0.3- 3 s at level 1. The average reaction time of 20 participants was 4.3 s at alertness level 4, 3.6 s at level 3, and 2.0 s at level 1. It can be seen from these results that the reaction time of drivers when the automated driving system switched from automated driving to manual driving was 2.3 s slower at alertness level 4 when compared"

Automated driving systems are a system for supporting the safety and comfort of drivers, but it is thought that delay times for driver operations shown in this study (e.g., providing information or sounding warnings in advance) should be considered when needing to switch to manual driving due to functional limits of the system. Furthermore, drivers in an alert state can more rapidly and accurately operate vehicles, so it is thought that also providing a system that detects the alertness level of drivers during automated driving and prevents driving in a low awakening state could be effective."

As a result, it was confirmed that the system using sounds had the most effect on the brake operation, and the system using display also had a certain effect. In the future, it will be necessary to examine the method of providing the information of traffic participants in blind spots in a more complex way. And it will be required to create appropriate HMI by studying methods, which can allow drivers to recognize the information of traffic participants more quickly in blind spots."

And it was found that the safety evaluation was higher by presenting the alarm at the timing applied to each driver rather than the one at the uniformly set operation timing. In the further study, various model construction methods such as TDNN, NARX, and LSTM have been proposed for driver models using machine learning, so it is necessary to consider the appropriate modeling method for constructing individual driver models."

By using the learning effect under the unconscious condition, it is thought that not only sound but also vibration and flashing of light which do not cause discomfort to the driver can be used as an alarm, and it is possible to design an alarm which is more acceptable to the driver. It can be said that DS is indispensable for such research on safety."

                                    "content": "In Section 6.8, it was concluded that accurate driving operations in automated driving systems that have a mechanism for switching from automated to manual driving became more difficult as the low alertness level of the driver became higher when switching from automated driving to manual driving. And drivers in an alert state can more rapidly and accurately operate vehicles, so it is thought that also providing a system that detects the alertness level of drivers during automated driving and prevents driving in a low awakening state could be effective. Comparisons of the experimental results of the driving characteristics of sleeping and alert drivers falling asleep during automated driving and transitioning into an awakening state at expressway exits show that, for the braking characteristics during emergency avoidance behaviour, drivers in the sleeping state had a long reaction time until initiating braking operations and smaller maximum brake pedal force. There is a need to sufficiently awaken the driver before switching to manual driving if the driver has fallen asleep during automated driving."

The advantage of tests using a driving simulator is that it can reproduce dangerous traffic situations and tests safely. Driving simulators are also valuable in research and development into intelligent driving systems, allowing for testing and evaluation in a simulation environment rather than on the road."
