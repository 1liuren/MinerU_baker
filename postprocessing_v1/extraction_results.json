By doing so, it almost becomes the usual installation space of a desk and chair for one person, and the installation space can be drastically reduced.

The purpose of using this simple DS is to analyze the driver state during automatic operation.

However, if we consider the DS as a whole system, we must also include the human part. That is at least one person technically capable of making a diagnosis of the problems and dealing with them when they occur, someone knowing what is possible to be achieved with the simulator and correctly advise the users in their research. In general, that person or the group of persons in charge of a DS must have not only the knowledge about the simulator itself but a good understanding of the goals of the research and how the simulator performs best in different scenarios. In most cases that knowledge comes from trial and error and becomes an accumulation of techniques applied to overcome difficulties such as simulator sickness, and lack of fidelity in the physical, visual, and other feedback given to the driver. It also includes building practical dynamic scenarios and dealing with many other operational issues that may exist. Each simulator has strengths and weaknesses; specific knowledge is always necessary to use or deal correctly with them. However, knowledge of another simulator's design and usage is highly recommended, and the persons in charge of a simulator should have the opportunities to study other simulators. This knowledge not only helps to make better use of the simulator, but it also gives useful indications on how to improve or upgrade an existing simulator architecture. To conclude on this point, when building or purchasing a new simulator, the human component of the system is",

Replaying data ensures that the test conditions are always the same, reduces the time a driver must be in the simulator, and finally helps to make consistent improvements economically. For instance, replaying data is used a lot in the development of sensor fusion algorithms, as acquiring real sensor data each time is not possible. But it can be used for less evident purposes like tuning a motion cueing algorithm (MCA) or debugging timing issues in a scenario.",

For simulators with large FOV, we often find a portion of or a full cylinder, sphere, or prism, sometimes used in combination with a floor screen. The immediate advantage is that there is no separation in the display surface, which allows generating an uninterrupted image. As a counterpart, geometrical correction of the image is mandatory, so that seen from the driver viewpoint, the scene is not distorted. Second, the projected images of two adjacent projectors overlap, but without any processing, so that the overlap band is twice as bright as other areas. The brightness correction that solves this problem is commonly called edge blending. The software that generates the image can be in charge of these transformations. That is also, in general, a less expensive solution. However, if the simulator must run with two or more different software solutions, it might be necessary to consider using a projection system that is able to deal with the geometrical and brightness corrections directly. So the often time- consuming setup and configuration of each software can be avoided.",

One method is to make the display system physically combined with the motion system.

Usually worn on the user's head, HMDs can also be mounted on a helmet in case of aviation applications. In both cases, the HMD integrates a small LCD in front of one eye (monocular HMD) or a display in front of each eye (binocular HMD), which gives the user a sense of depth (Figure 3.8). Combined with a head- tracking device, it allows moving and rotating the camera in the virtual scene by replicating the motion of the user's head.

The system then gets the amount of torque that needs to be applied to the steering wheel of the simulator. The system can inject this value in the force- feedback control that generates torque on the hardware. How the system concretely calculates and uses that value to control the force of the steering wheel depends on the algorithm of the software application; the algorithm itself is sometimes the subject of study in the research. For general driving purposes, the software uses more or less complex mathematical models. The general process is to calculate the effect of the steering angle on the vehicle dynamics, then to determine the force that would occur on the steering shaft. That force comes principally from the reaction between the tire and the road surface. The power steering or power- assisted steering of the vehicle also modifies this force. In that case, the algorithm can be a fixed algorithm with some parameters that the user can change.",

For a steering wheel, it would be too low a value, and it would not be possible to control the direction of the vehicle with enough precision as it would require too many unnatural adjustments from the driver. Fortunately, nowadays, most steering wheel systems provide more than 10 or 12 bits precision with, respectively, 1 024 and 4 096 possible values. Above 12 bits, it becomes difficult to notice the difference while driving for casual drivers, and some systems provide even 16- bit signals. It is still imperative to understand that the resolution in the signal may not be the same as the physical resolution of the sensor.

Cogging is the irregularity in the torque due to static magnetic forces of the motor and other design and manufacturing quality. Finally, some natural friction exists and generates a resistive torque and damping when turning the wheel even if no electric current flows to the motor.

However, as it is the response of the car to the current angle of the steering wheel, it is naturally a closed- loop system where the frequency of the control loop becomes essential. The rate of the loop depends on how fast the software can calculate the feedback and communicate with the motor control unit. In many instances, some high- frequency responses cannot be correctly reproduced with only a direct torque control from the software. It becomes especially noticeable when the torque is almost null and, in worst cases, can also prevent the system from stabilizing at the wanted angle. Most steering wheel systems, to deal with these issues, provide additional control functions like generating extra friction and damping forces.

It also contained a hole of the size of the pupil, and a light thread attached the harness to a recording lever, allowing to record the horizontal and vertical movements of the eye onto a smoked surface of a kymograph cylinder.

From the simulation of the tires included in any physical models, we can directly derive the steering feedback force. It is less trivial to find models for pedal and vibration feedback in simulators, and they are often developed as additional features getting information from the primary vehicle simulation, without sending back their results into it. Nonetheless, they can be quite critical in some scenarios to give proper immersion and feedback to the driver.",

Algorithms for ADAS impact performance and safety, and testing them with a full extent of hardware precision error, noise, and failure is a crucial point for engineering them. Regarding sensors, first, there are precision errors by design that can be reasonably straightforward to model and simulate. If we take the example of a pre- crash system using object distance information retrieved from image processing of a stereo camera, the sensor is limited in the precision in which it can capture the distance of objects. By design, the pixel resolution, FOV, and spacing between both cameras are the essential factors that set the precision of the sensor. From this information, a simple equation gives the error range depending on the distance of the object. A simple way to simulate that error would be to add a random value generated within the calculated error range. But, other precision loss or failure to measure a distance can occur because of the limitations of the program that analyzes the stereo image. For instance, a simple stereo image processing is sensitive to reflections, lack of contrast, or lack of color change in the image. Errors and failure patterns must be analyzed and modeled to be simulated meaningfully, and sometimes it is simpler to take the physically based approach. In that case, the physical approach would be to simulate the raw data stream of the stereo camera and use that data with the actual image processing algorithm. In that case, the challenge shifts from simulating the final results of the sensor to creating photo- realist computer graphics.",

We saw that the vestibular sense feels rotation speeds and accelerations while mainly only feeling accelerations of linear movements. The algorithm tries to provide the best linear acceleration cues and rotational cues. We must notice that it is a chance we do not feel linear speed because it would not be possible to reproduce them in a limited space. In turn, rotations of the yaw angle in the horizontal plane can be relatively long, so if feeling them becomes necessary for the research, a turntable can be added. A turntable can provide yaw angle accelerations and speed for a relatively long time, so even curves of more than $90^{\\circ}$ can be mostly reproduced. Relatively to pitching and rolling, a vehicle usually does not rotate more than what a Stewart platform can, so they are relatively simple to reproduce for algorithms.",

The first thing that an MCA must provide is the onset cues when the vehicle starts a new movement, which means a change in acceleration or non- null jerk. For this, the platform must accelerate in the same direction as the vehicle does but still has to stop, so it does not reach its physical limits. A Stewart platform only provides few centimeters or few decimeters of movement in general, so clearly, the platform has to stop very soon after reproducing an onset cue. By chance, we feel gravity as acceleration with the vestibular system, and proprioception through the pressure change on the back of the seat. Using that fact, we can use tilt coordination to create an angle with the horizontal, so gravity applies a force in the horizontal direction relative to the vehicle reference. While tilting is activated and provides the feel of linear acceleration for a time as long as desired, the platform can return to a more centered position so it can provide future linear accelerations again. About tilting, we must remember that the ideal center of rotation is the head of the driver, while vehicle rotations should be applied at the vehicle rotation center. Let us now decompose the process in phases and see where problems occur and what the algorithm must solve.",

The Stewart platform must adapt its posture according to the orientation of the yaw table by changing the axis of the tilting angles to counter that issue. Also, the movement envelope of a Stewart platform is not purely circular, which means it cannot rotate or translate in the same measure in every direction. Still, there is a range in which the platform movement capabilities are symmetric with regard to its center. If the platform is kept within that range, it can adapt its posture to the yaw angle of the turntable. We must still consider that even if the driver does not feel this adaption movement of the angle, it requires actual movements from the platform. It is using a part of its acceleration and speed capacity for changing its posture instead of providing cues to the driver.

We saw that one significant optimization of motion cueing comes from improving the tilt coordination. If the system only responds to the current vehicle data input, it can only react from that point and start tilting from after the acceleration of the vehicle started. If a future acceleration is predictable, it is possible to start the tilting movement earlier, while canceling the false acceleration with linear movements, then providing acceleration cues when they arrive in the input. This method requires accurate prediction, so the synchronization with the acceleration change is optimal. Otherwise, a wrong specific force would be felt due to too early tilting. Another way to use prediction is simply to move the system near the opposite excursion limit of the one that would force to stop the linear acceleration generated by the simulation. In any case, the preparation of the motion system for the next acceleration must be done under the perception threshold of the driver, requiring a prediction of several seconds.",

This technique is not recent, but we would recommend that the reader refers to Grottoli et al. [57]. They explain very well the advantage of that methodology compared to a standard approach. Of course, that method relies on recorded data and is not applicable for real- time driving simulation. An overview of the research shows that traditionally, the calculation necessary to optimize motion is very demanding in computer power, so even if the data were known in advance, it would not be achievable to use such algorithms in real time. To solve that issue Beghi et al. [58] show how to use an advanced technique to lower the calculation cost so the algorithm could run in real time, but the method still relies on accurate knowledge of the vehicle movement of the whole simulation. Mohammadi et al. [59] propose a method to stabilize an MPC with only a short prediction horizon instead of using a large time frame or the whole record of the drive.

Software providers, from that point, worked to integrate traffic and driving simulation into one simulation environment, knowing that it would help to solve the issue of bringing, in simulation, the user into the road and transport system.

From that angle, there exists a tight relationship between the evolution of cars in a new environment and XR technologies that possess the potential to entertain, teach, or even help passengers discovering new things. For instance, the system could show information that is normally invisible from the vehicle, or, on the contrary, replace non- essential elements and remove visual pollution. We can also imagine a system that presents practical information on a location, or historical and cultural content about a particular place, street, or monument. We must also mention that this prospect is supported by the general progress of VR on smart devices, which at the same time helps the development of VR on embedded hardware that we can use in vehicles. This new perspective is an evolution that benefits from the progress of independent technologies such as XR, machine learning, autonomous driving, and HMI, that interconnect through the automotive industry. It is still difficult to predict how cockpits will look like in the future. Still, we could also say that this situation is very similar to the relationship that existed between DS and VR in the beginning.

For this, we can immediately conclude that contrary to video games or movies, the content of the computer graphics is not made to impress the viewer, it should not add exaggerated visual effects that may distract the driver. On the other hand, we could say that it is more important to provide high resolution, contrast, and brightness than in other cases where the visual content can still be enjoyable without high- end hardware performances. Here we do not want to minimize the importance of proper hardware for entertainment, and we could even argue that most hardware developments were made thanks to this market.

It is important to note that while the computer performs shading for each fragment, material attributes are only stored for each vertex. This helps tremendously to reduce memory use but, in some cases, falls short of providing enough information to represent complex materials. In such cases, textures are used, so that every fragment can have different material properties. It is also possible to use several textures to refine the material even further.",

One of the main benefits of using physically based materials is that describing them is done using real and measurable properties, like the metal content or the smoothness. This description method can significantly accelerate the data creation and ensure the accuracy of the materials, regardless of the lighting conditions. Of course, using physically based materials requires a physically based rendering approach (as explained in Section 2.3.2), which means the software must implement a shading model for each type of material, for instance, metals, glass, and water. Implementing those models is time- consuming at first, but results in a way more accurate output and does not necessarily slow down the rendering process. In the context of a simulator that would be used to evaluate human- machine interfaces, the accuracy of the material surfaces is paramount. Therefore, physically based materials and rendering is a necessity. For a better understanding Figure 4.2 shows a range of material properties affecting the reflection of light on the surface of the object.",

It could even be used to represent the sky of extraterrestrial worlds, should that become a requirement for an autonomous driving simulator. The implementation is not overcomplicated (many implementations are available online), so it quickly became the most used model in modern simulators or games. In more recent years, some updates included the solar radiance evaluation to be able to draw the sun disc accurately, as well as other improvements, most of which are accessible online on freely accessible repositories. Figure 4.4 shows the sky rendered with variety of parameters (vertical axis) at different hours of the same day (horizontal axis) using the Preetham model.",

For a specific light source, candela data is given for each direction of interest, in which the source emits light. More candela measurement points provide a higher resolution of the light beam patterns; therefore, a more accurate representation of the light. To provide the perceived color of an object, we must calculate the amount of light reflected by it. When calculating the reflection at a particular point, we calculate the direction from which light arrives and the intensity of this light. The direction is known from the relative position of the point and the light source. Once the direction is known, it is possible to use the candela information to calculate the amount of light arriving at the point. If candela information is available for that direction, the software can use it as is. Otherwise, an interpolation from the nearest available data provides an estimate.",

The resulting pattern could be recalculated and resent to the shader program each time it is modified. If the control resolution of the beam pattern is not as high as the actual lighting pattern resolution, it is possible only to send the beam control data and let the shader recalculate the pattern on the fly.

The surface of the road, for instance, in reality, is made of many asperities visible from the driver's point of view. We see it in the form of shadows and change in color that give the grain of the surface. It would demand too much from the GPU to store all the vertices and render the geometry of the asperities and other irregularities of the road only using a geometrical definition. With regards to geometrical details, depending on the desired level of detail, significant parts of objects shape are represented with polygons and some surfaces that can be considered flat and defined with only one polygon. Surfaces defined flat, but that, in reality, include visible geometrical details and color patterns use texturing to represent them.Also, already explained about the modeling of trees and vegetation, masking is another method to simplify shape definitions while representing complex ones.

It is essential to notice that as the distance from the viewpoint increases, potentially more objects become visible in the scene. So not using different levels of details efficiently may force the user to reduce the maximum viewing distance during the simulation.HighFigure 4.19 LOD conceptual diagram",

In that case, particles are often rendered as sprites with some transparency. We previously explained that semi- transparent polygons should be rendered with some sorting algorithm. For smoke, it is possible to simplify the algorithm to use a large amount of particle without lowering the rendering time. As long as a unique color is used for the sprites, it is not a problem to draw them in a random order as the final blended color stays the same.

The whole right of the car is more illuminated than other sides because the surface normal is oriented towards the sun (diffuse component). The right doors of the car are brightly highlighted because the surface orientation makes the light emitted by the sun being reflected directly at the camera (specular component). However, this does not explain the front of the car, which is visible while being oriented oppositely to the sun (using only direct lightning; this part would be completely black). With global illumination, any object is illuminated from the surroundings. In this particular case, the sky in front of the car (and behind the viewpoint) illuminates the front of the car. That part of the sky is probably darker than areas next to the sun, resulting in a darker illumination. We want to clarify the fact that global illumination does not modify the Phong illumination model in any way as the calculations of the diffuse and specular components do not change. Still, the light is like a sphere surrounding objects and not a single point, resulting in, as can be seen in Figure 4.28, very realistic representations of objects.",

These parameters can be provided as textures to have nonuniform materials. For example, a new car is well polished, and roughness might be close to 0. After some years, some areas might be more worn out than others, effectively becoming rougher: it is easy using a texture to adjust the roughness of the material in certain areas only. Figure 4.33 shows a vehicle rendered using a metallic- roughness model where we can see the left side of the car (on the right in the image) with a brighter reflection than the front of the car.

HDR rendering ensures that light is simulated accurately. But since inputs and intermediary calculations are unbounded, the question becomes: how to \"fit\" the result within the bounds that the display equipment can accept? We use tone mapping to solve that issue. Concretely we use a curve to define, for an unbounded input, a corresponding bounded value. There have been many kinds of research conducted on the subject of tone mapping, and many algorithms have been extensively used by games and movies (Reinhard, ACES, etc.). One thing to remember about tone mapping is that there is no \"best\" or \"most accurate\" tone mapping. The process of tone mapping is inherently subjective. It should be adjusted to particular display equipment and purpose. For instance, some movies tend to be very dark while games aimed at kids are brighter and have vivid colors. The following figures (Figures 4.34- 4.37) present a few examples of the same scene being",

The IGs then render the content of the image according to the latest simulation data and then send the image buffer to the display hardware (Message Nb. 5). For synchronization, the timing at which the image buffer is sent to the display hardware and the simulation data used to generate the images must be the same.

After sending message 2, IGs wait for message 3 before asking the GPU to send the image to the display hardware.

We could solve that issue by adding more control in the synchronization. However, more control requires more messages or higher thresholds, which reduce the available time for rendering the scene.

The data is sent over some kind of network (most often Ethernet) between computers, so any congestion on the network can profoundly affect the performances of the system, add delay or different response time between computers. So it is imperative to ensure the local network is stable and performant. The connection between the computers and the display hardware is another area that can impact the system. In large simulators, there is often a long distance between the computers and the display devices. The amount of data that must be sent does not allow for long HDMI or Display port cables, and some sort of signal amplification or conversion to a more stable medium such as LAN cables or optic fibers is necessary. This type of connection adds more intermediate devices on the link, which then becomes more prone to connection problems. Selecting suitable quality devices and cables, plus ensuring the installation is clean and not affected by electromagnetic fields generated by power cables, for instance, is important.",

At first, $M$ times of data of one subject are averaged to be a representative value of the subject. This operation is carried out for all $N$ participants, and $N$ average values are obtained. Then, the normal distribution process can be applied to this mean value. This is because, according to the central limit theorem, the mean value from any original distribution follows the normal distribution. As a result, the $t$- test can be applied to the mean value of $N$ persons if there is no significant difference when the conditions are changed. To make the assumption of the normal distribution stronger, increase the value of $M$ times. In general, the goal is at least three times, preferably ten times. However, there are some cases in which repeated trials are difficult depending on the contents of the experiment. Therefore, it is important to confirm the distribution shape beforehand in the preliminary experiment.",

However, since the error judgment involves subjectivity, statistical processing is used to provide objectivity.

Near- infrared light (from $650~\\mathrm{nm}$ to $1000\\mathrm{nm}$ ) passes through tissues and is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) in the blood. When light of a certain wavelength passes through a substance, the absorbance is proportional to the concentration of the substance present in the sample and the optical path length. Since the optical absorption spectra of oxygenated Hb (oxyHb) combined with oxygen and deoxygenated Hb (deoxyHb) dissociated from oxygen are different, the state of oxygenation can be known from the change of Hb concentration, when the absorbance of near- infrared light over two wavelengths is measured. When an irradiation probe and an absorption probe of near- infrared light are arranged on the scalp with an interval of about $3\\mathrm{cm}$, light which comes out from the irradiation probe and advances on the arc are detected by the absorption probe and the Hb quantity on the optical path can be calculated. That is to say, NIRS makes it possible to observe the condition of oxygenation of Hb in the capillary of cerebral cortex which exists from $2\\mathrm{cm}$ to $3\\mathrm{cm}$ under the scalp as shown in Figure 5.11.",

Therefore, when the response time measurement results are shown, the start and end points must be accurately described. Time headway (THW: distance between vehicles divided by own vehicle speed) and time to collision (TTC: distance between cars divided by relative speed) are typical inter- vehicle distance and inter- vehicle time which show spatial margin between own vehicle and preceding vehicle.

On TTC, it is said that the driver judges the brake start based on the reciprocal of TTC.

In this section, validity is defined as the certainty that the evaluation can find out the true characteristics that suit the purpose of the evaluation. On the other hand, reliability is defined as the certainty of how accurately the evaluation result is obtained and is independent of whether it is the true characteristic to be evaluated. The following will focus on validity of evaluation using the DS. When trying to secure validity of evaluation using DS, it is necessary to inspect whether the evaluation purpose can be achieved by using DS. The motivation that an evaluator tries to use DS is because an experiment is difficult in the actual environment owing to some reasons. Namely, an evaluator asks a DS for the experimental reproduction equal with environment. However, even if its evaluation has validity in actual environment, the evaluation which is reproduced by DS is not necessarily to have validity. This is because the current level of DS technology is limited and can only reproduce the actual environment partially and basically. Due to the nature of the evaluation, the validity of evaluation using DS cannot be established without equivalence to the actual environment. Therefore, when it tries to prove the validity of evaluation using DS, it's equivalence must be checked by comparing the evaluation results in the actual environment with the evaluation results in DS. Otherwise, if it is possible, it is better just to conduct evaluation in the actual environment and there is no meaning to use DS. Moreover, it is difficult to conduct this comparison in the evaluation which assumes a dangerous situation such as the situation occurring in a traffic accident. There is some research on adjusting DS by the data acquired by the above comparison in a specific situation [13- 16]. However, even if this adjustment is conducted perfectly, strictly speaking, there is no guarantee of getting evaluation results equal to them in the actual environment except in situations where this comparison proves equivalence. It should be thought that the current DS technology has only limited reproducibility and it would be impossible to prove the validity of",

If DS can provide the information equal to the information which is provided by the actual environment for the driver and its evaluation has validity in the actual environment, it is thought that evaluation using DS would also be able to have validity. In this case, the most important point is \"the actual environment for the driver,\" not the actual environment. As mentioned above, the current DS technology cannot provide the information equal to information that is provided from the actual environment perfectly. However, if the limit of information that a DS can provide exceeds the amount of information that the human perceives from the actual information, in other words, the amount of information that the human can use to recognize the actual environment, the DS is equivalent to reproducing the actual environment for the driver. It is thought that a human cannot use all the abundant information that is provided from the actual environment. For instance, a human only receives necessary visual information from among those that are provided from the actual environment and this bottom- up information is complemented by a high- order brain function that performs as top- down processing (binocular stereoscopic processing, shadow stereoscopic processing, etc.). Then humans regenerate visual space in the brain by this process. It may not be necessary that DS can provide all of the visual information that is provided from the actual environment.",

Vection is the moving sensation that occurs by only providing visual information which is got when humans move without providing physical moving information. For instance, when you get on the train while seeing a train that stops at the next platform through the window and then this train begins to move, you may have felt yourself moving in spite of your train not moving [27]. This sensation is vection. Vection would be considered a sense of compensating for vestibular sensation. Namely, vection is one of the strongest supporting sense systems for DS that is difficult to provide the information of vestibular sensation. Presently, it is thought that the visual information with the wide- angle provides a high sense of presence. This is based on the study that circular vection tends to occur because of visual information with a wide- angle [28]. On the other hand, it has been confirmed that linear vection occurs by only providing the extending visual information to the central vision area [29]. Namely, When the DS is used in a scenario where the vehicle is driving on a highway, it may be not necessary that DS provide the visual information with wide- angle in order to get the high presence equal to the actual environment, unlike when the DS is used in a scenario where the vehicle turns an intersection on a city area.

Especially for the driver, it is important in driving to perceive the absolute speed of the vehicle. Then, the visual information that becomes the information source is the optical flow generated by the stationary object. In other words, it is important for the driver to feel that the optical flow is firmly caused by a stationary object. The shaking of the image caused by this jitter of CG may prevent the driver from feeling the object expressed as a stationary object in CG. In case of setting big stationary objects in a distance, it may be important to express a decrease of contrast due to the absorption of light by air for these stationary objects by CG. The optical flow, which is the visual source of information that gives the driver a sense of speed, changes with distance. It is also important for the driver to correctly recognize the sense of distance from the stationary object in order for the driver to perceive the absolute speed. The decrease in contrast due to the absorption of light increases as the distance increases.

In that sense, vection performs the important function of compensating the sensation of one's own movement. Examples of devices that stimulate the vestibular sensation in DS include six- axis motion devices, translation devices, and turntables.

If there are differences in the reproducibility between the perceptual information provided by DS, it is necessary to pay attention to the scenario provided by DS. For instance, when DS is used to realize a scenario in which a vehicle turns left or right at an orthogonal intersection, it is relatively easy to provide the necessary visual information. On the other hand, it is very difficult to provide vestibular sensation information suitable for this scenario on the DS. If the DS cannot completely provide vestibular sensation information that is consistent with the visual information, it is basically better to give up on realizing this scenario with this DS. If this scenario is reproduced by this DS, the lack of vestibular information for the visual information occurs. This lack does not simply mean that the driver is not provided with the vestibular information. This lack provides information that there is no vestibular sense information that should be provided originally and exposes the driver to the situation where physical contradictions occur between visual information and vestibular information. It is thought that our perceptual information processing is basically applied for the situation with physically consistent perceptual information. Therefore, in the above case, the relation between the perceptual information is physically broken, and it is considered that it is difficult for a person to perform perceptual information processing. It becomes difficult for the driver to build spatial perception, and there is a concern that DS sickness may occur. In that sense, it means that the DS cannot provide the driver with the perceptual information equal with the actual environment at the",

In the case of automated driving, the driver is not involved in the operation at all, so it can be said that the vehicle is outside the driving which is out of the feedback loop. That is, after the take- over request, the driver can be thought of as returning to the manual driving operation, understanding the situation, and starting the manual driving operation to complete the driving feedback loop by manual operation.

Conversely, what about switching from manual driving operation to automated driving? The author has experienced this in the driving support system, and so there is no problem. With ACC, the driver simply turns on the set switch and he/she can safely leave the pedal. The same goes for switching to automated driving, where the driver can turn it on at any time. If you are worried that automated driving might require a special HMI, try it out on a DS, as we did in the take- over experiments. In driving support systems and automated driving, the driver entrusts the driving operation to the automobile, which greatly increases the utilization of the DS. When the driver drives the vehicle manually, the behavior of the vehicle in response to steering wheel operation and the feeling that the behavior of the vehicle imparts to the driver through the steering wheel are strictly required. However, in the case of ADAS, the driver does not have a severe sense of feeling required to drive the vehicle through the steering wheel, and therefore, if the DS pays attention to the graphics representing the driving environment, the generation of G may not be as accurate as during manual driving. Therefore, even low- cost DS can be fully utilized.",

Technical dependency: A/IS should provide reliable services, and trust means that A/IS can enhance human-driven value and securely and actively achieve its designed objectives. The technology should monitor that its operation is consistent with human values and meets the prescribed ethical objectives of respecting rights. In addition, the verification and verification process should be developed to be auditable and authoritative.",

Perhaps all the windows in the automated driving vehicle are smoked so you cannot see inside.

This was a triplet of lamps mounted on the top of the truck windshield, and the number of lamps on the green varied with speed. The speed indicator lights are all turned off when the truck is stopped, and one light is automatically turned on at speeds of $40~\\mathrm{km / h}$ or less, two lights are automatically turned on at speeds of $40~\\mathrm{km / h}$ to $60~\\mathrm{km / h}$ or less, and three lights are automatically turned on at speeds of $60~\\mathrm{km / h}$ or more. Pedestrians can know the speed of the truck by looking at the number of the speed indicator lights of the truck coming from a distance. It was useful as a primitive form of a vehicle- pedestrian communication tool. However, it was abolished in 1999 because it would become an import barrier. The speed indicator was unique to Japan. It was a victim of the automobile export war. Even imported trucks could be approved if they were modified and equipped with speed indicator lamps, but they were regarded as import barriers because of the cost of modification. In addition, some pedestrians who did not have a driver's license did not even know the meaning or existence of the speed indicator lights, and the fact that it did not function well was a remote cause of the abolition.",

At the very least, you will need something to show that it is the automated driving vehicle so it can be recognized correctly by other traffic. As a means of communication with pedestrians and other vehicles other than blinker and passing, it is possible to attach an electric bulletin board facing outside the vehicle. On- board electronic bulletin boards are often used by public vehicles for traffic regulations and construction guidance. Electric bulletin boards are sold not only in public vehicles but also in stores, where messages such as \"Thank you\" and \"After you\" are displayed or printed in flowing characters. However, under the current Road Traffic Law, it is necessary to be careful when lighting other than the lights, and strictly speaking, lighting while driving may violate the law in some countries. In the inexpensive one, LEDs can be arranged in a matrix, dot characters can be selected to store several patterns, and messages can be displayed depending on the situation. Adding speed indicator light to this and providing the message for every situation could be the tool for communicating with the outside of the automated driving vehicle. However, it takes longer to read the message than it does to turn on the blinker or pass the ball, and it can not be identified from a distance. Therefore, it is necessary to have a means of communication that can be understood instantly.",

What kind of system do you have in mind for the automated driving vehicle to do the same? For an external display, it may be necessary to use a large display for conveying pictograms and personified pictures in an easy- to- understand manner, rather than the display for text. Alternatively, a number of lighting devices may be set on the vehicle roof so that they can be viewed at $360^{\\circ}$ and from a distance, such as speed indicator lights used in heavy- duty trucks in Japan, and the lighting pattern may be changed depending on the state of automated driving. This requires standardization and regulation around the world, but there are no language barriers and children can understand them. Mercedes- Benz is actually researching and developing a way to communicate between automated driving vehicles and pedestrians [36]. Here's how Mercedes- Benz recommends communicating between automated driving vehicles and pedestrians. This is a lighting device that is under development in a concept vehicle called a cooperative car, indicating that it is operating automatically for approaching pedestrians. A light arranged on the roof of the vehicle indicates that the vehicle is the automated driving vehicle, and the movement of the vehicle is displayed by the lighting method of the lamp. Lights located on the windshield, front grille, headlamp, mirror, lower part of the side window, etc., positioned so as to be visible from any angle of $360^{\\circ}$, indicate the driving mode of autonomous driving and the lamp located on the roof indicates the movement of the vehicle (slow flashing indicates deceleration, fast flashing indicates approaching pedestrians, etc.). Mercedes says these represent the vehicle's own will and can communicate with pedestrians. The lamp on the roof emits turquoise blue as a color which gives a sense of security to pedestrians by examining each color. Flashes of red or yellow, like warning lights, may cause uneasiness among pedestrians and hinder the spread of automated driving, so colors that provide a sense of security are a well- considered choice.",

In order to precisely control the light distribution, the projection of three LEDs is composed of 1.3 million micromirrors, and the angle of the micromirrors is finely controlled to create the light distribution pattern. Since the light distribution is fine, the glare of oncoming cars and pedestrians is minimized compared with conventional headlamps. Of course, an external recognition sensor detects other vehicles and pedestrians and adjusts the light distribution to the most optimum possible from the navigation information and the position of the vehicle. Then, a guideline is indicated at a place where the road width becomes narrow, and a mark indicating the direction of a pedestrian is also displayed. The marks projected onto the road may be recognizable by pedestrians, although this may only be at night. So could the digital light processing unit be the new communication tool for vehicles and pedestrians?",

The F015 was Level 5 fully automated driving vehicle with the tagline Luxury in Motion. It is a phrase that expresses the state of realizing an interior in which the front seat can rotate backward and face the rear seat because there is no need to drive. In order to communicate with pedestrians, F015 installed LED matrix display units on the front and back of the vehicle to display messages. When there is a pedestrian, a zebra zone showing the pedestrian crossing is drawn on the road by a visible light laser, and the pedestrian can be urged to walk. When the pedestrian swings his/her hand, he/she understands the gesture, draws a text, and communicates with the pedestrian. Mercedes- Benz hired a social psychologist to research and develop a system to communicate with the pedestrian.",

The DS has technical limitations at this time, on the other hand, drivers do not use all the information provided by the actual environment. Namely, the DS does not have to provide the driver with all the information provided from the actual environment, and the information that the DS can provide only needs to include the information used by the driver. Even if there is a limit to the information that the DS can provide, this can be done by optimizing the provided information or limiting the usage scenarios based on the mechanism of perception of the information used by the driver. If the information used by the driver can be covered by the information that can be provided from this limited DS, it means that it may be possible to design a DS that can obtain exceptionally reliable experimental results.

The advanced support systems often use meters, mirrors, and the information display to inform drivers the operating status and to alert them the emergency. Most of the systems that are actually on the market inform drivers the possibilities of collisions by the combination of warning displays and warning sounds when the systems are activated. However, as the number of types of systems grows, the amount of information increase, which cause difficulty for the drivers to immediately recognize what danger the warning is for. In the future, the amount of the information provided will be expected to be increasing much more by utilizing the technology of C- ITS that is a communication technology with other traffic participants, such as vehicle- to- vehicle and vehicle- to- pedestrian communication [1], which is considered by companies and governments. When the drivers receive many information in dangerous situations, they may panic or drive in the wrong operation. When the display position is not appropriate, the information cannot be properly transmitted to the drivers, and the systems may not be effective enough to avoid collisions. In order to reduce these risks, it is necessary to study how to provide the information so that drivers can easily recognize and intuitively decide how they should perform the driving operation.",

The activation timing of alarms is set in order not to interfere with the drivers' normal operations. When the alarm interferes with the driver's driving operation, there is a possibility that the functions of the AEBS are not fully utilized by providing unsolicited feeling to the driver. However, there are various timings of drivers' operation in normal driving. By presenting an alert early for some drivers, it may be possible to take actions with sufficient margin to avoid collisions without interfering with the drivers' operations. Therefore, this study examined the effect and effectiveness, using the driver model reflecting the individual driving characteristics for the activation timing of the AEBS alarm. (Figure 6.4) As driver models, transfer function models, crossover models, forward gaze models, fuzzy models, and neural network (NN) models have been proposed. There are also tailor- made driving support systems [2] that reflect the individual characteristics of drivers, using the driver model. In this research, we used a NN, which measures the nonlinear driving operation of a driver and could model nonlinear control to model it. The driver model is constructed by training NN to learn driving operations of a driver. The driver model monitors the driver's operation by estimating the driving operation of the driver. When the driver's operation is different from the normal driving, such as a delay in brake operation, the driver model makes the decision to present an alert. In this study, we examined the effect by applying the driver model to the alarm activation timing.",

In general, the intermittent sound of high- frequency band such as $1 - 4\\mathrm{kHz}$ is used as the warning sound in order to sense the sense of urgency. This is because humans tend to feel a sense of urgency about \"a high- frequency sound that is regularly periodic and intermittent\" [4, 5]. However, in the scene of high urgency, we thought that calm sound rather than urgent sound could act calmly, so we adopted low sound as the alarm and conducted experiments. Noise in the car is noise from the road and muffled noise. The sound from the road surface has a frequency of $5 - 30\\mathrm{Hz}$, and the muffled sound has a frequency of about $5 - 200\\mathrm{Hz}$ [6]. Therefore, the intermittent sound of $250\\mathrm{Hz}$, which is slightly higher than the noise in the car, was considered as the adopted warning sound. As a result, the response time of the driver for the dangerous event became earlier, and the driver did not feel the trouble compared with the present alarm sound [7].",

In devising this technique, the physiological phenomenon of the human was referred. It is generally known that the human respiratory cycle changes by various factors, and it is reported that the respiratory frequency decreases when sleepiness occurs [13] and that the respiration synchronizes with rhythmic movement of limbs and visual stimulation. From these facts, it was considered that the lowering of the respiratory frequency was avoided by presenting the blinking stimulation in the usual respiratory cycle for the visual sense of the driver, by synchronizing the actual respiratory cycle with the blinking stimulation, and as a result, it was connected with the maintenance of the arousal condition.",

The frequency of blinking stimulation was 17 times per minute (3.5 s per attempt), referring to the general respiratory cycle of the adult. The intensity of the light source was set as shown in Figure 6.21, because the ratio of inspiratory, expiratory, and rest periods was roughly 1:1.5:1 in one breath of a human. That is, the LED gradually brightens at the inhalation of $1\\mathrm{s}$, gradually darkens at the expiration of $1.5\\mathrm{s}$ after reaching the maximum luminance, and the loop which maintains the darkest state for $1\\mathrm{s}$ as a rest period is repeated until the end of the experiment.",

On the attitude of the cooperation person under the experiment, it was made to be fundamentally a relaxed attitude of the person himself, and it was made to be a condition in which both hands were put down except for the button operation of (2) and (3). To reduce the influence of the order of experiments, the order of experiments was random for each subject. These experiments were conducted on two separate days for each subject. Since the progress of the experiment was greatly changed by traffic conditions and adjustment of an electroencephalograph to be described later, the number of experiments per day was from 2 to 4. And, the rest hour over $10\\mathrm{min}$ was set between each experiment in principle. Since the way of spending during the break was made to be free, there were various things such as drinking, conversation, going to the toilet, and operating the smartphone by the cooperators. Most of the subjects got off the driving simulator during the break. This experiment was approved by the bioengineering research ethics review committee of Shibaura Institute of Technology. Before the experiment, the contents of the experiment and the protection of personal information were explained, and the experiment was conducted with the consent of all subjects.

In this study, the subjects were classified into six attributes (\"young, middle- aged, and elderly\" in \"male/female\") shown in Table 6.13 to obtain driver data for different ages, and each subject was recruited. The experiment was conducted between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. due to the arrangement of subjects. Since the driving behavior is expected to be carried out in various scenes of daily life, the effect of the meal on the experiment day on the drowsiness was expected, though large restriction was not set in the experiment, and the intake of the caffeine was limited in addition to hearing about the meal before the experiment. Four of the 16 subjects were excluded from the analysis because the conditions differed from those of the other subjects due to insufficient experimental equipment or errors in teaching to the collaborators during the experiment. Results are shown for 12 persons (six men and six women; mean age $46.67 \\pm 18.60$ years) whose experimental conditions were unified.",

It is said that the effect of the active action on the arousal is large, and it is effective for the finger difference call of the railway operator in the familiar thing. And, the conversation is also noticed as an active action, and the arousal effect by the conversation during driving and monotonous work are studied. The present experimental results show that the active task has a higher arousal maintenance effect than the passive task. Since the inside of a vehicle is narrow and the same posture is often observed for a long time, it is considered that the active load of holding the steering wheel and actually rotating the steering wheel effectively led to the arousal maintenance. And, there was \"I woke up just by holding the steering wheel\" as a comment of the subject person after the experiment. From this, it was indicated that the degree of concentration to the driving naturally heightens by becoming the same posture as usual driving, even if it is recognized to be the automated driving in the brain.",

This means that the effect of the stimulation greatly changes by the age group of the driver. As the factor in which the falling sleep tendency which is different by the age group appeared, we consider sleep disorder and functional depression of the sense organ with the aging. In general, it is known that human sleep changes with age. In particular, it has been reported that the elderly have decreased total sleep time, increased shallow sleep, and decreased sleep efficiency due to arousal from sleep [14]. In this experiment, the existence of these symptoms is uncertain, because the life rhythm of the subject is not accurately grasped. However, when these symptoms occur chronically to the driver, even if the person intends to take the sleep time of the previous day sufficiently, the sleep is not actually sufficient, and the sleepiness may easily appear in the daytime. In addition, the tendency of early to bed and early to rise by the progress of the sleep phase is easy to appear in the old people, and this seems to become a factor of the sleepiness generation in the daytime. Aging is also known to affect sensory organs such as vision and hearing, and symptoms such as visual field narrowing, hearing loss, and reduction of the audible range appear. As a result, there was a possibility that the elderly driver could not see the arousal maintenance stimulation, could not hear the driving sound from the simulator, and could not feel the arousal maintenance stimulation in comparison with the young and middle- aged driver. From the above fact, it seems to be important to consider not all drivers uniformly, but age group and characteristic of the user deeply when dealing with the awakening of the driver. All the contents described here are hypotheses. The number of data used for the analysis is also 3- 5 persons for each age group, and it is insufficient for completely grasping the characteristics of the age group. In order to clarify the relationship between the age group and falling asleep, it is necessary to increase the number of experimental subjects in each age group and to conduct large- scale experiments focusing on the daily life rhythm of drivers.",

On six kinds of environments including these five kinds of tasks and the condition of doing nothing, the experiments using the automated driving function of the DS were carried out for general drivers of 16 persons, and the arousal maintenance effect was compared. As the result, though 10 persons in 12 persons fell asleep under the condition of doing nothing, it became possible to reduce the number of persons by carrying out each task.

On the stimulation, not only the simple work task like this time, but also the arousal maintenance task which adopted the active work such as phonation and conversation should be checked. In addition, since the sleepiness of the driver is expected to be greatly affected by the sleep of the previous day, the meal immediately before and the time zone, etc., the control of the experimental condition and the change of the driver characteristic by the change of the condition, etc. would also be examined.

From this result, it was proven that the accuracy hardly changed on the classification using RRI, CVRR/RMSSD, and RMSSD, comparing the classification result of machine learning by the combination of the conventional index with the combination of the newly introduced index. Therefore, in view of both reaction time and classification accuracy, the classification using the above new index seems to be more suitable for the arousal degree judgment. In the future, we will judge the arousal degree by the above index.",

Organizations in each country, such as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and SAE International, have defined the roadmaps of fully automated driving systems, in which drivers are not involved in driving at all. The roadmaps include a system that stops the automatic driving function when the automatic driving system reaches the functional limit and shifts to the manual driving. In this system, there is a possibility that drivers cannot perform appropriate driving, when the drivers have been in low awakening states, such as drowsiness, at the timing of switching the system from automatic driving to manual driving.",

After the ego vehicle traveled on the highway using this automatic driving system, an interrupting vehicle appeared from the merging lane at a position $56~\\mathrm{m}$ ahead the ego vehicle and broke into the lane at a speed of $16.7~\\mathrm{m / s}$. At the moment when the interrupting vehicle started braking into the lane ahead the ego vehicle, the automatic driving system was canceled. After the automatic driving system was canceled, the driver had to control driving. Since there was the difference of a speed between the interrupting vehicle and the ego vehicle, the driver needed to perform a driving operation to avoid a collision. In this experiment, we examined the drivers' behavior for avoiding collision at that moment and compared the avoidance behaviors of the drivers in between low arousal states and arousal states. When the system switched from automatic driving to manual driving, alarm sounds were presented to notify the drivers of switching the system. Figure 6.42 shows a schematic diagram of the situation in the experiment.",

Autonomous driving systems are the systems to support the driver's safety and comfort. However, when the system's functional limit requires the switching to manual driving, the delay time for driver's operations shown in this study should be fully considered. For example, the provision of information and reminder in advance might be effective for the delay time. In addition, drivers who are in arousal states can perform the driving operation quickly and properly. Therefore, it might be effective to use two types of systems together: one system to detect the driver's wakefulness during autonomous driving and the other system to prevent drivers in low- arousal states from performing driving operations.",

      "text": "The cerebral cortex is composed of about 14 billion nerve cells which show weak potential changes along a certain rhythm that is related to the activity state and stimulation of the brain. A potential fluctuation of several tens of $\\mu \\mathrm{V}$, including a frequency component of $0.5 - 100\\mathrm{~Hz}$, can be obtained when actually attaching an electrode to the scalp and amplifying the biological signal with a biological amplifier. A record of such electrical phenomena in the brain is referred to as an EEG. Each part human cerebrum is related to perceptual information processing and body movement control, and it is said that inferences on the relationship between human behavior and brain function could be made by measuring the potential fluctuations derived from each of the parts of the cerebrum. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology determined 21 points in the head for deriving EEGs, and this derivation method is called the 10/20 electrode system (10/20 system) [26]. Actual measurements involve picking and choosing from these 21 points specified by the 10/20 system as a basis. Figure 6.47 shows a conceptual diagram of the 10/20 system and the derivation sites in the 10/20 system. This 10/20 system can be classified into the two methods of the reference derivation method and bipolar derivation method. The reference derivation method measures potential differences by attaching one electrode to an unrelated electrode such as an earlobe and another electrode to the scalp, and this has been used in clinical examinations. The bipolar derivation method records potential differences between two points on the scalp. The reference derivation method, which is often used in the field of ergonomics, was used in this study, and the three locations where $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ waves clearly appear (Fz, Cz, Pz) were measured [27]. Frequency analysis on the measured EEGs also results in its classification into the three frequency bands of $\\delta$ (less than $4\\mathrm{~Hz}$), $\\theta$ ($4 - 8\\mathrm{~Hz}$), and $\\alpha$ ($8 - 13\\mathrm{~Hz}$). The $\\alpha$ frequency band can be further classified into the slow, mid, and fast $\\alpha$ frequency bands. Generally, $\\beta$ waves are called fast waves, and both $\\delta$ and $\\theta$ waves are called slow waves. Slow waves appear when the level of alertness and consciousness are decreased. The $\\delta$ wave band appears during deep sleep, the $\\theta$ wave band appears during the drowsy state in the early stages of falling asleep, and the $\\alpha$ wave band appears during mentally calm states or when light stimulation is blocked from closed eyes [27, 28].",

The automated driving system placed from levels 1 through 3 in NHTSA and SAE in the automated driving system roadmap shows that this is automated driving, but this is mainly operated by the driver. Therefore, drivers must constantly monitor the automated driving system.

This indicates that there is a risk where drivers may temporarily not be able to conduct the monitoring in an automated driving system.

Also given that the autonomous vehicle was driving at a speed of $27.8~\\mathrm{m / s}$ and the interrupting vehicle was driving at a speed of $16.7~\\mathrm{m / s}$, there was the possibility that the autonomous vehicle and interrupting vehicle could collide after the interrupting vehicle merged in front of the autonomous vehicle.",

This was because once the driver experienced the fact that there was an interrupting vehicle, the driver would anticipate future occurrences and mentally prepare for this, changing their driving operation. Similarly, this was because it was assumed that the system switching to manual driving under situations which the driver did not predict would occur in environments where the automated driving system was actually used.

These values were analyzed by only extracting the $\\alpha$ wave band (8–13 Hz) detected when in a low awakening state. Figure 6.65 shows a comparison of the data where EEGs 1 min after the start of experiments were collected for $10~\\mathrm{s}$, and data where EEGs immediately before the start of the scenario (immediately before the interrupting vehicle started to interrupt) for collected for $10~\\mathrm{s}$. Figure 6.66 shows an explanatory diagram of the measurement timings of each EEG. It shows that the participants at level 1 started the experimental scenario immediately after convocation. In contrast, participants at levels 3 and 4 drove for approximately $1\\mathrm{~h}$ after convocation under a low awakening driving time and started the scenario after confirming their transition to a low awakening state. Therefore, the Figure 6.65 is the $\\alpha$ wave immediately after convocation, and the graph is immediately after the start of the scenario.

It can be seen from these results that over $90\\%$ of sleeping drivers collided with pedestrians due to delayed visual recognition of pedestrians and inability to forcefully press on the brake. Therefore, driving immediately after awakening may be linked with serious accidents, and there is a need to sufficiently awaken the driver before switching to manual driving if the driver has fallen asleep during automated driving.
